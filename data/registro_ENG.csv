V01750355;. a) Manager/society’s vision of the market situation. Capital markets maintain the positive tone we have been enjoying since the beginning of the year, with widespread increases in most financial assets. Although interest rates have continued to rise and most of the advanced indicators point to a strong slowdown in the economy, the markets opt for a smooth landing scenario, where growth and inflation would moderate, and the dreaded recession would be avoided. In this context, fixed income assets show a positive performance during the first half of the year. Shorter assets, because their profitability will be updated as the rates rise, and their high carry-over (bonds IRR) allows absorbing the negative impact of the latest rate hikes on prices. Longer ones, because the strong investment of the curve, which discounts lower interest rates in the future, favours longer positions. Private debt benefits, in addition, from narrowing credit spreads., 79%. For their part, the world exchanges close the semester with an average revaluation of almost 14% (MSCI World in euros).If during the first trimester the best performance corresponded to the European exchanges, which benefited from the improvement of economic expectations after the Chinese reopening and the fall of the prices of the energy, in the second trimester the stars of the market have been the Nasdaq, which lives a moment of euphoria linked to the development of the artificial intelligence (IA), and the Japanese Nikkei, which has become the new great history of restructuring.These two indices have been revalued 13% and 18%, respectively, during the last trimester, and they already accumulate 32% and 27% in the year.This movement of the exchanges has been very concentrated in the companies of greater capitalization, and in particular the companies of the FAGMNA (Facebook (Meta), Apple, Google (Alphabet), Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon), that in 2023 has been revalued the average sector, led by Nvida (+189% and Meta (+13)., In the case of currencies, although the dollar against the euro has been relatively stable, the main Asian currencies, yen and yuan, have been depreciated sharply, falling by 11% and 7% respectively. Finally, we have seen significant falls in energy and raw materials prices most exposed to the cycle, while gold is appreciated by more than 5%. b) General investment decisions taken. The negative correlation between interest rates and credit risk premiums, together with a rather cautious view of the economic cycle, have led us to gradually increase the duration of portfolio rates. we believe that, if the economy suffers and risk premiums increase, the duration will cushion part of the movement. This increase in duration, we have done by incorporating short periods of time from the curve, both American and European. We maintain a positive view of corporate credit., We consider that the improvement of the margins of intermediation thanks to the increases of rates will make up for the increase of the lateness. Credit differentials are still above those seen before the bankruptcy of SVB and the intervention of Credit Suisse and the market of AT1 is becoming normalized with the return of issuers. In variable income we maintain a defensive positioning, taking advantage of the rebounds in Europe to change positions towards the US and strengthen our vision in Asia. We have started to rotate the portfolios from cyclical companies to those with more defensive biases and that has led us to increase the weight in sectors of stable consumption, pharmaceuticals and utilities. In foreign currency we have maintained a bearish positioning on the dollar. Given the economic situation, we see it contributing in a wide range in 2023. This has led us to increase the exposure at the end of the 13 semester. c) Index of reference. The management takes as reference the period of profitability of the MSCI AC World d Return index, we have merely used the index of information in 2023., 73% in class L within a normal level of expenditure for this fund that includes the expenses by management commissions on assets, depository, audit, etc. No commissions on results (only the collection of the amount generated at year-end is made effective). The breakdown of the synthetic expenditure ratio, to identify which part of it is due to the IIC itself (direct expenditure ratio) and which part corresponds to the investment in the underlying IICs (indirect expenditure ratio), is the following 0.51% direct and 0.42% indirect for class A, 0.31% direct and 0.42% indirect for class L. The evolution of the equity has been negative reducing this period by 10% in class A and 7.7% in class L, the number of participants has decreased by 169 in class A and 1 in L, the total of members of the fund amounts to 1,395. The net return of the fund has been located in 8.20% for class A and 8.4% for class L. e) Performance of the fund compared to the rest of the fund of the management. The funds of the same category of SAU variable income compared to 2.;. a) Concrete investments made during the period. In the environment described the fund has been moved during the semester in a range of exposure to variable income between 92% and 97%. The average level of exposure has been 93%. The topic of climate change remains in which we have the greatest conviction, with an average weight of 39% of the patrimony. Within it we have taken partial benefits in the Robeco Smart Mobility fund from 3% to 1%, after the excellent behavior of the fund and in total in Vaneck Agribusiness ETF, since we saw a lower route to the agricultural assets. On the contrary, we have increased the weight in the IShares Global Clean Energy from 3% to 4.7% and in Mutuafondo Energy Transition from 3.4% to 4.6%. The second mega trend with more representation in the fund was technological disruption, which represented 23% of the patrimony. After the excellent behavior during the first semester, led by the assets of Artificial Intelligence, we have taken benefits, reducing a little the weight of all the funds of this mega trend, up to a weight of 18.5% of the patrimony, which represented 23% of the mega trend of consumption 23% increased by Brand., and AB Sicav International Healthcare with a weight of 8% and 7% respectively compared to the previous 6% are the main stakes. In the rest of the investments we took profits at the beginning of the year at Janus Horizon Pan European Real Estate, after the good start of the real estate sector, selling the 2% we had. In addition, we maintain 4% at Robeco New World Financials, which benefits from the current rate environment, and we have added two positions in emerging variable income: Fidelity Sustainable Asia (3.6%) and Fidelity China Consumer (2.0%). We think that Asian countries will behave better in the described environment, and in particular the companies exposed to the return to normalcy of the Chinese consumer. Finally, and in addition to our variable income exposure, we have introduced a fund of the manager OFI (OFI Energy Strategy Metals) that invests in a basket of metals that benefit from the energy transition with a weight of 2.7% of the assets. b) Transactional operation in derivatives and temporary acquisition of assets., fixed income, and foreign currency to adjust exposure levels to our asset allocation objective d) Other investment information. The depository institution has remunerated the amounts held in current account under the agreed terms. 14 Assets in dispute: N/A Duration on equity at the end of the period: N/A Tir on equity at the end of the period: N/A Investments in other funds: Robeco (14.5%), Fidelity (10.6%), Rest of managers with weights below 10% Investments classified as 48.1.j: N/A 3.;. N/A;. Volatility indicates whether, historically, the liquidative values of the fund have undergone significant variations or whether, on the contrary, they have evolved in a stable manner. A highly volatile fund has a higher implicit risk. Thus, it is a measure of the frequency and intensity of changes in the liquidative value. The annual volatility of the fund has been at 8.91% and 8.92 % for classes A and L decreasing in both cases compared to the previous semester. The current level of annual volatility is at a lower level compared to the annual volatility of Ibex 35, which was 10.77% and lower than that of its benchmark (9.79%) and higher than that of the Treasury Letter with maturity of one year, which was at 5.72%. The historical VaR, which is the method used to measure the overall risk of the fund, indicates the expected loss of the fund with a confidence level of 99% over a period of one month, taking into account the current composition of the fund and recent market behaviour., In this calculation, the term transactions corresponding to the usual spot operation of the market in which they are carried out are not considered, those in which the delay of the acquisition is forced, the total return swaps, nor the strategies of management with derivatives in which no additional exposure is generated. The operation with derivative instruments may involve market and counterpart risks. At the end of the quarter, the percentage of derivative instruments measured by the IIC equity commitment methodology is 6.35%. 5.;. The increases of rates implemented in the last 18 months begin to impact on the companies and individuals that have a lower access to credit and higher financing costs. Virtually all the advanced indicators of economic activity, such as the ZEW, the ISM or the slope of the curves of types, point to that we will enter a phase of strong decline in activity, particularly in the industrial sector.We also begin to see some symptoms of weakness in employment.The ISM manufacturer of June already indicates that the American companies plan to reduce their rate of hirings, and although the number of redundancies remains exceptionally low, the figures of hours worked or hourly earnings seem to confirm this trend.The European case is even more worrying because Germany, the main economic engine of the Eurozone, has two quarters in recession situation, and its industrial model, dependent on the cheap energy of Russia and the demand of China, seems to be in question only in a more polarized world from the political point of view.The evolution of the exchanges depends, fundamentally, on the evolution of the business benefits.If, as it all seems to indicate, we are heading to a lower phase of economic slowdown, and less than 10%, it would be expected to the economic slowdown.
V01769819;"A) VISION OF THE GESTORA/SOCIETY ON THE SITUATION OF THE MARKETs As a continuation of a particularly volatile year, the equities suffered additional turbulence in the last quarter of the year. As in the previous period, the same topics again imposed strong corrections: inflation, central bank policy to lower that level through major rate increases, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, data from a global economy overheating and the energy crisis in the European Union negatively affected markets, creating uncertainty by 2023. In addition, the brutal change of the zero policy Covid in China had an impact on investors and generated a feeling of uncertainty when competing to limit inflation. If during the half of the semester a recovery with the reference rates to the rise, with the reopening of China and good figures from the American economy, the levels of inflation remained high in all developed countries - although it could already be observed signs of the impact of the central banks' policy on the world economy. According to investors, it appears that central banks remain committed to fight against inflation, despite all the inherent signs of global growth, the economy is already seen in December.""}, The anticipation of further rate increases in this context had an impact both on fixed income and on equities and credit spreads were also affected in such a way that they knew a strong expansion, 9 investors anticipating more credit events as a result of the debt burden. Now, everyone is seeing the American LIBOR rates of reference landing at about 5.00% at least. Additionally, several news directly affected the national markets and specific regions. In particular, in Europe, countries are looking towards the next 2023 with several elections and the neighbouring conflict in Ukraine. Likewise, in China, the reopening of the economy and the end of the zero policy Covid will potentially have as an impact a strong pressure on the prices of raw materials. B) GENERAL DECISIONS OF THE ADOPTATE INVESTMENT The managed fund has reduced its exposure to risk assets with an investment of 40% in equitable income ESG and 35% in fixed income with a neutral period. The US is the main bet on both types of assets. C) The EFITANCE has been managed by the fund with a risk of 40% and 35% in fixed income with a neutral index., {'translation_text': ""The fund's assets at the end of the period amounted to 243,368,805.31 euros, representing a variation of -7,11%, compared to the previous period. As for the number of members, at the end of the period the fund has a total number of members, which is a variation with respect to the previous period of -6,25%. The synthetic expenditure ratio of the period has been 1,97%. The profitability of the fund in the semester is approximately -1,07%. The fund, being a subordinate fund, invests more than 10% of its assets in other funds (at least 85%) for the investment in IICs, 0.68% for the commissions carried back by the investment in other funds of third parties and -0.73% for direct expenses (Table 2.4.).

P. Morgan Mansart Multi-Active Protection Fund EUR Class B (acc) has been made at the beginning of March 2021 with additional changes during the period, in particular in the exposure to fixed income of degree investment.

It corresponds to the degree of investment in the asset of risk., In order to ensure the orderly settlement of IIC positions through the normal contracting mechanisms, the management company has adopted procedures to avoid conflicts of interest and related transactions carried out during the period. The fund has carried out transactions linked to those provided for in Article 67 of the ISIC and Article 139 of the RIIC. A monitoring body of the management company has verified that these transactions have been carried out in the exclusive interest of the IIC and at prices or under conditions equal to or better than those of the market, thus complying with the related transactions procedure laid down in the internal rules. Investments underlying this financial product do not take into account the EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities10. During the reference period no excess or non-compliance has occurred which has not been regularised before the end of that period. 3.";. Not applicable;. The fund has had an accumulated volatility in the year of 2.72%, which is used as a risk measure. By way of comparison the volatility of the reference index of the fund, for the same period, has been placed at 1.75% and the volatility of the Treasury Letter to one year has been placed at 0.92%. Indicate that greater volatility means greater risk. 5.;Again the prospects for a more aggressive monetary policy but this time with more controlled inflation, and the war between Ukraine and Russia, will have an important weight on the stability of the world economy. The volatility of recent months does not seem to cease in its upward trajectory, with a season of results that will surely be impacted by the brake effect created by central banks, commodity prices and the cost of debt. However, we should see a monetary policy in pause (but hakwish still) with less rapid rate hikes both in Europe and the United Kingdom and in the United States.
V01773456;"The first half of 2023 has been marked by the resilience of the global economy to the impact of the strong increases in rates that occurred during the year 2022 and much of this year. Central banks’ struggle against persistent inflation has led to a vertical movement of official interest rates in a very short period of time, causing debate about its effect on the economy over the course of the semester, by the various economic agents. And this impact has been less than expected, at least to date, which in some cases calls into question the effectiveness of the transmission of monetary policy on the economy. Despite all this, it has been a half-yearly rise in the labour market in the United States and in Europe that has given signs of being more robust than could have been expected after a dizzying rate rise and such a strong energy shock, as a result of the war in Ukraine. Despite all this, it has been a half-yearly high in the behavior of the markets and in terms of financial news. If we started analyzing the evolution of inflation in the US as a whole, it has been the low level of inflation., As regards core inflation, the path has been similar, although less sharply moving from 5.7% to 5.3%. It seems that at this time of the year there are certain components of underlying inflation that are more ""sticky"" and that take longer to adjust. In the case of Europe the trends are similar and general inflation has gone from 9.2% to 6.1% in this first part of the year, while the underlying inflation has been more resistant to this adjustment in the European case 14 being placed at 5.3% in May compared to 5.2% in December. In the case of the resilient US labour market, we have seen a first semester which, despite maintaining a strong net job creation ended the semester with a slight slowdown, with levels reaching 220k since the 300k. The unemployment rate in the USA is at 3.7% having slightly rebounded from levels of 3.4%/3.5. In the case of Europe this unemployment rate has been placed at levels of 6.5% in a stable way throughout the period. These data are compatible with the advanced indicators of activity that show the highest level of activity in ISM4., 6 to 51.2. In Europe, aggregate economic growth has been non-existent, with a high dispersion among the different countries: it highlights the positive impact that services contribute to growth in Spain, which contrasts with the industrial recession experienced by Germany. In the United States, the economy has continued to record growth that surprised the rise over the course of the semester, contrasting with what has been pointed out by some of the advanced indicators. Central Banks reacted to data on inflation, labour market, advanced indicators and growth. We have attended a semester with a Federal Reserve in a somewhat less restrictive attitude to monetary policy. Thus, in the four meetings held over the past year, the Fed has raised rates in the first three at a quarter point (25 basic points) while at the last meeting it has taken a breath of time in the increases., This was not the case of the European Central Bank, which started the year by increasing the rates 50 basis points in February and continuing that path in March with another 50. It has already been at the meetings in May and June where the increases have been limited to 25 basic points placing the rates at 4% but with a message of continuity in those increases. All these adjustments of the monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic indicate that the economic cycle is different in both regions but that the bulk of the work of the central bankers, as far as increases of rates are concerned, can be already done. The impact of the increases of rates affected the financial balance of the regional banking of the USA. And it has caused turbulence and bankruptcies in the sector, with cases like that of SVB and First Republic, with an active contagion of ideosyncrats on Europe, in the case of Credit Suisse. The rapid reaction of the government and American regulator allowed to isolate the contagion. In Switzerland, the intervention of the regulator of the Credit Suisse promoted an affect of the capital in the first half of the first half of the economy, in the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the year., China, which continues to grapple and disappoint in its reopening process, maintains a pattern similar to that of developed economies: advanced indicators of manufacturing in contract territory, but with a more powerful service sector. Unlike its counterparts in developed markets, the Chinese central bank has been introducing stimulus measures to boost credit through the reduction of bank reserve requirements. Another aspect to highlight and which has greatly helped to correct inflation globally has been the widespread drop in commodity prices during this semester. It highlights the correction of 50% of the price of natural gas and about 12% of oil, which leads to energy indices to correct about 21%. Industrial metals correct about 15%. And also food falling between 4% and 8%. On the other hand, markets have had a spectacular half in terms of profitability of risky assets. But also in the case of conservative assets, for the hope of the end of the cycle of rate hikes accompanied by resilience in the economy that allows it not to fall into recession or, if this occurs,, If this occurs, it will be very mild. Nasdaq has closed its best first semester of history with +39% positive. There have only been 10 times before that Nasdaq has risen by 20% or more. The SPX has closed to 30 June with a positive return of +16% compared to a historical average for this period of 5%. This has only happened on 19 occasions since 1928 in which the index has risen more than 15%. In the European case, the Eurostox 50 has closed the first part of the year with a profitability of +16%. Also, there have been only 10 occasions in which this index has closed a first semester with more than +10% positive. Another market that has given the surprise has been Japan with increases of the NIKKEI 225 of +27%. It has been both the emerging countries where on average the increases have been more modest, registering growth of the order of 4%. As far as the fixed income has been, the profitability has been positive in the titles of the American governments (+1.6%) and the European ones (+2.1%). The corporate credit of high quality of +5., The percentage of investment of the debt of financial issuers remains around 63.01% of the portfolio. The rest of the subordinated debt of non-financials has been made to serve the liquidity windows, on the 12th day of each month. The percentage of investment of the debt of financial issuers remains around 63.01% of the portfolio. The rest of the subordinated debt of non-financials. c) Reference index. The management takes as reference the profitability of the index 50% ICE BofA Euro Investment Grade Contingent Capital Index (COCE) + 40% ICE BofA Euro Non-Financial Subordinated Index (ENSU) + 10% ICE BofA Euro Subordinated Financial Index (EBSU). The management takes as reference the profitability of the index only for information or comparative purposes. d) Evolution of the assets, shareholders, profitability and expenses of the IIC. The assets of the fund have decreased by 799k Eur in the portfolio class, has decreased by -8k Eur in this class, and in this class 1.07k Eur in the extra class and -2,600 Eur in the statistical class., 62% (standard class) higher than that of its benchmark which was 1.41% in the period. e) Fund performance compared to the other funds of the manager. The profitability of the fund has been higher than the average profitability of its category which has been 1.63%. 2.";". a) Concrete investments made during the period. During the period the structure of the portfolio has been maintained while the liquidity sales were going to be attended on the 12th of each month. The structure of the sales has focused both on maintaining the specific weights of the original construction of the portfolio, and on avoiding the percentages of concentration per issuer above 40%. The combination of these two factors, is what has taken precedence when it comes to undoing portfolio within this fund with the philosophy ""Buy and Watch"". The portfolio remains invested in subordinated fixed income of both financial and non-financial issuers. The positions that have had the greatest contribution to the perfomance of the portfolio, have been those of Electrice de France and Energías de Portugal. On the other hand, the ones that have had the worst behavior during the semester, have been the Erste and Abn Amro. b) Operating of securities loan. N/A c) Operating in derivatives and temporary acquisition of assets. The fund has carried out transactions with derivative instruments to manage the portfolio in a more effective way. The average degree of leverage has been of 0%., At the reference date of the information, the return which, in gross terms (calculated as an average of the Internal Return Rates or TIR of the portfolio assets) would in the future be obtained by the IF for the maintenance of its investments on maturity. The return finally obtained by the fund will be different when affected, firstly, by the expenses and commissions attributable to the IIC and as a result of the possible changes that could occur in the assets held in the portfolio or the market evolution of the issuers’ interest rates and credit. As for the remuneration of the liquidity maintained by the fund it has been 0.32%. This fund can invest in low credit quality fixed income emissions, that is, with high credit risk. 3.";16 N/A;The volatility of the fund has been 8.10% in all its classes, higher than its benchmark of 7.63 per cent. 5.;. In this environment, our view of markets has been evolving towards greater neutrality within the universe of risk assets because we have been decreasing the likelihood of a recession in the short term. In this sense we came from a prudent position regarding the behavior of the exchanges where the uncertainty generated by the impact of the increases of types and episodes such as that of regional banking in the USA or the absorption of Credit Suisse by UBS, show that it could not be ruled out that there were more events of financial destabilization that affected the financial markets in a very negative way. It seems that, for now, that is not the case and the mitigating measures together with a revival of the American growth cycle, which is digesting the increases of rates with an still very robust labor market, make us lower the prudence with which we had started the year and exploit more tactical factors versus strategic ones. As regards the approach to fixed income we have also reviewed our positioning while maintaining and reinforcing a cautious view on the American fixed income assets where we do not rule out major increases of rates as a consequence of the robustness of the cycle but we do not act as this case of economic income is also reviewed.In the second part of this year we can see if the big rate rise is finally moving over the economy and if the signals sent by the advanced activity indicators are only slowing down or behind them there may be a more significant movement. In our central scenario, the latter does not seem most likely.
V01900604;". a) The manager/company’s vision of the market situation 17 Central banks have followed the same trend as last quarter of last year, carrying out intense monetary tightening activity during the semester to try to contain inflation levels. Inflation data have continued to rise, especially in the first part of the year, so both the actions and messages of central banks have been very aggressive. However, in the second quarter of the year we have seen a slight downward trend in price growth, so it seems that we could be reaching the end of the cycle of increases, although the monetary authorities continue to give speeches of monetary tightening. The Federal Reserve (FED) has not achieved rates a total of 75 basis points in this semester, in order to meet the high levels of inflation, until leaving them in a range between 5 and 5.25 per cent. The aggressive policy maintained in the last 9 months has not achieved the objective of the EDF, we mean both to reach the target of levels below 2 per cent in terms of inflation and to harden the labour market. However, in the last meeting of the semester, it has decided to take a step in the last half, it has not achieved the objective, we mean both to reach the objective of levels below 2 per cent in terms of inflation in terms of inflation in terms of inflation., To be dependent on the data and lack of control of the inflation since the general rate at the end of the semester was at levels close to 4.00% and the underlying, which excludes food and energy, at levels above 5.00% For its part, our European Central Bank (ECB) rose 150 bp in four rate increases during the semester, two of 50 basis points and two of 25 basis points remaining in the range of 3.50% (deposit rate) to 4.25% (creditability facility).The evolution during the year has been of more aggressive actions in the first part, with increases of 50 bp in the first two meetings as a result of terrible inflation data, and 25 bp increases in the following two meetings.Inflation data of the general rate, after a peak of 10.1% at the end of last year, have tended to decline to levels of 5.50%.However in the underlying rate, which excludes food and energy, there is no downward trend since it is above the levels of the EDF, unlike the general rate., 10%. With the change of president of the monetary authority the policy seemed to be more aggressive, however the lower level of inflation than the rest of countries makes them less active in terms of interest rate increases. Notable theme is the Bank of England (BoE) since it is the most aggressive monetary entity given the inflation levels that the country has affected both the same problems as the rest of countries and Brexit. During the semester it has increased the rates 150pb to 5.0%, with inflation data far above the rest of developed economies, the general rate at 8.7% and the underlying rate at 7.1% levels. The Central Bank of Brazil braked in August last year at the tightening of its monetary policy keeping the rate at 13.75 per cent, achieving a reduction in inflation to levels close to 4%. The Swiss SNB has continued to tighten monetary policy with two increases, a first of 100pb at its first meeting of the year and another of 25pb to leave the reference rate at 1.75 per cent. , listed the negative rates for the first time in a decade with the increase of 75 basis points of interest at the rate of 0.5 per cent., Following a lower incidence of covid as well as citizen protests, the government decided to suspend Zero Covid’s policy across the country. The Chinese Central Bank (PBOC) in the face of the lack of economic growth after the reopening decided to introduce monetary expansion measures by lowering interest rates. In addition, the government introduced measures to support the real estate sector to prevent new problems such as those that occurred during the past year. To point out that during this first semester we saw problems in the banking sector with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and Credit Suisse in Europe. The first was for incorrect management of the balance sheet that led the Fed to agree to liquidate the entity in order to avoid contagion to the rest of regional banks in the US. The bankruptcy of the American bank caused the customers of Credit Suisse to start withdrawing the money from the entity so that the Swiss Central Bank forced UBS to buy the entity in order to avoid a financial collapse of the country. These problems in the financial sector were brief after the interventions of the monetary authorities., The war between Russia and Ukraine remains a terrible social drama as no solution to the conflict is apparent. Ukraine seems to be recovering ground in front of a Russian president who is increasingly weakened in the face of internal problems both by international isolation and by the military revolts that are taking place. On the other hand, the risk of a Chinese intervention in Taiwan remains latent and it is not ruled out that in the 18 future we will see an increase in tension.In terms of economic growth, the measures taken by the central banks should lead to a slight recession in the economies in the coming months, the employment data are not suffering so if we see a fall in the economies this will be limited. In this sense the American economy has slowed its growth rates to 2% in the first quarter of this year and is expected a growth rate slightly above zero by the second quarter of the year. In the Eurozone, the growth rate of the first quarter was also of +1% and, like the US, we expect very low growth figures for the second quarter of this year. In respect to the employment data, the US remains practically in full employment with about 3,5% of the lowest unemployment., ISM and PMI manufacturing data indicate recession in the sector as they are at levels below 50 and, however, those in the services sector are clearly above 50 what implies expansion.In the Euro Zone, despite good data from the service sector, the poor performance of the manufacturing industry has led to confidence rates being at recession levels Fixed income evolution Central bank decisions and comments from different members reiterating the need to control inflation through interest rate increases, has had its impact on each of the sovereign reference curves.On the US side, the slope of the curve was reversed further during this semester up to the -109 basic points reaching the US 10 years at 3.84 per cent and the US 2 years at the end of the period. In the old continent, the different behavior between the United Kingdom and Europe as a consequence of the economic isolation of the first post-Brexit and its lack of inflation control. Thus, the GILTS, in the two-year period, went from the basic rates (290 per cent at the end of the period, to 3,5 per cent at the end of the continent, highlighted the different behaviors between the United Kingdom and Europe as a consequence of the economic isolation of the first after the Brexit and their lack of control of inflation., 39% profitability) and the two years increased 45 basic points to mark a profitability of 3.19%. The peripheral debt, has had a good behavior in line with the 10 years German. The 10 years Italian was quoted at the close of the period in 4.06% (-63 basic points) and the Spanish in 3.38% (-28 basic points). Although penalized by the recessionive fears and the lesser buying action of the central banks, the corporate debt has had a positive performance in the semester especially in those of high profitability that have narrowed -73pb in Eurozone and -54pb in USA, more than the credit in degree of investment or of high credit quality in Europe (-17pb) or in USA that tightened -15pb in USA. Evolution of the income variable income has completed a semester not seen in recent years, with generalized increases both in the markets developed and in the emerging ones. Despite of doubts, mainly with the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley or Credit Suisse, the markets have each time we have seen corrections has taken advantage to make purchases that has led to the exchanges to revalues important, the more flexible circumstances have been supported in this way., The US had very positive data thanks to the behavior of the technological Nasdaq, +38.75%, and the SP 500 increasing by 15.91% in the semester. The problem on the other side of the Atlantic we see it in that the good stock exchange behavior has been thanks to only 5 values, since if we consider an identical weight for all the values of the SP this index would be around 6% in the period. On the other hand, the European indices recorded important increases. Thus, the average of the euro area, the Eurostox 50, gave up 15.96%; the Italian FTSEMIB, 19.08%; the CAC 40 French, 14.313%; the DAX 30 German, 15.98% and the IBEX 35 Spanish, 16.57 %. Outside the euro area, the FTSE 100 delivered a 1.07 %, the OMX 30 Swedish, 13.04 % while Switzerland rose a 5.13%. Another outstanding index was Japan that went up 27,19%. As for the emerging countries, the overall index rose in the period 3,46%. By regions, the emerging Asia rose by 1,6 % and the Latin America., {'translation_text': ""27 since 1.20 at the end of 2022. The more advanced monetary policy in the UE makes the currencies of the Euro Zone and of the UK appreciate in front of the American green ticket. Evolution of the raw materials Brent's barrel corrected a -9,25% (measured by its spot index) in the first half of the year. The risk to a global recession along with the disappointing reopening of China has led to that, despite the strong cuts of production of OPEC, the price of the crude has presented a bad behavior in the period. The price of natural gas follows its downward trend, corrects in the year about -84%. Industrial metals, with the exception of copper that hardly presents variation, fall in a significant way: nickel, -53lmi%, iron alloy, -9%, or aluminum that corrects a -19,36%. The precious metals also rise, with the war +5%, accompanying the movements of the dollar. Among the agricultural raw materials, the wheat corrects a -35%, despite the war in the Ukraine. b) General decisions of investment given to China The intense and rapid process of increasing rates of inflation of types started in the 20 years of 20 to 20 years.""}, This conservative view of the global macroeconomic scenario led us to start the year at the bottom, especially during the months of January and February, especially during the first half of this year, to think of the possibility that during the first half of this year we would be able to attend a recession of a certain depth. However, the reality that we have been able to observe these first months of the year, unlike in similar situations in the past, is that the sharp increases in rates carried out by the main central banks have not yet been able to depress consumption and activity in general and therefore not to moderate the high levels of inflation enough. The causes are multiple and diverge slightly according to geographies but could be summed up in the strength of employment, especially in the USA, the significant savings rates accumulated during the years 2020 and 2021 due to the consequences of the COVID and especially because of the appreciation of a significant change in consumer behaviour that far from being depressed by the rise in rates and the possibility of a complication of the economic scenario has been strengthened showing a somewhat short-term view of reality., with levels of investment below risk neutrality with an exposure to virtually zero equities which has resulted in the Fund’s performance being far from expected these months as it did not maintain exposure during the rise. We slowly closed the coverages as the market became resilient to weaken and we took advantage to accelerate the closure of the fall that occurred in March following the outbreak of the crisis in regional banks in the US and the resolution of Credit Suisse here in Europe. During the semester, the Fund was mostly invested in other third-party funds and more residually in addition to maintaining coverage with futures and liquidity. The Fund started the semester with a net exposure to near-zero variable income, to end the period at levels close to 15%. We maintain a net exposure to Europe very small for coverages, an exposure to global income around 12% and an exposure to US bonds close to 3%. With respect to the fixed income portion is concentrated in credit and in a range of average duration around 3 years partially covered by ETF reverses on the German Bund and the Italian BTP., The equity of the class FUND.C. CANTABRIA of the fund at the end of the period amounted to 571,666,41 euros, which represents a variation of -8,51%, compared to the previous period. As for the number of members, at the end of the period the class FUND.C. CANTABRIA has a total of 45 participants, which means a variation with respect to the previous period of -13,46%. The class FUND.C. CANTABRIA of the fund has obtained a profitability of -1,33%. The class FUND.C. CANTABRIA of the fund has borne indirect expenses of 3,451,693,28 euros for the investment in other funds. The ratio of synthetic expenses of the period for the class FUND.C.CANTABRIA has been of 1,14%. With respect to the class 20 FUND.C.EXTREADURA of the fund has borne an indirect expense of 3,451,693,28 euros, which means a variation of -12,29%, compared to the previous period.

The main managers in which the fund was invested at the end of the period were Candriam (15.22%), Lazard (7.20%) and Lyxor (6.10%), The total investment in investment funds at the end of the period was 98.5%. In the semester they were closed totally or partially positions in Candriam Equities Global Demographic, DWS CROCI US Dividends, BNP Paribas Mois, Dws ESG Float Rate Notes or DWS Top Dividend DFC among others. On the contrary they strengthened or opened positions on Global Growth Europe, Brown Advisory US Sustainable Growth, Lazard Credit Opportunities, Vontobel Global Corporate Bond or ODDO BHF Avenir Europe. On the contrary, the major contributors to the profitability of Global Growth Europe, Brown Advisory US have been increased., The fund invests in other funds that mostly integrate extra financial criteria of an environmental or social nature and of governance within its investment process. ASG factors are becoming increasingly important for the financial performance of the companies, so that those that best manage their risks related to environmental, social aspects and give importance to good governance become attractive to investors to the detriment of those that do not, and that are perceived as a source of potential risks. 21-30 June is met with the criteria required in the annex to the prospectus, in terms of the compliance of investments that promote environmental or social characteristics, as well as with the minimum of sustainable investments. b) Securities lending operation. does not apply. c) Derivatives operation and temporary acquisition of assets The fund used futures on the Eurostoxx 50 mainly as cover during the period, generating a negative return of 2,16%. The degree of average leverage in the period was 57.56%. The degree of coverage at the end of the period was 99.26%. II has not been agreed temporary acquisitions of assets over the term of 7 days. d) The company has invested in other securities, In order to ensure an orderly settlement of IIC positions through the normal contracting mechanisms, the management company has adopted procedures to avoid conflicts of interest and related transactions during the period. The fund has carried out transactions linked to those provided for in Article 67 of the IIC and Article 139 of the RIIC. A monitoring body of the management company has verified that these transactions have been carried out in the exclusive interest of the IIC and at prices or on terms equal to or better than those of the market, thus complying with the related transactions procedure laid down in the internal rules. During the reference period there has been no excess or non-compliance that has not been regularized before the end of that period. This fund may invest a percentage of 100% in fixed income emissions of low credit quality, so that it has a very high credit risk. 3.;. Not applicable;. The fund has had an accumulated volatility in the year of 3.59%, which is used as a risk measure. By way of comparison, for the same period, the volatility of the Treasury Letter to one year has been placed at 4.29%. Indicate that greater volatility means greater risk. 5.;. After the good behavior of the risk assets during the first semester and taking into account that in our opinion the conditions continue to be given for the economy to slow down noticeably at a global level or even to enter into a certain recession, we believe that it is likely that we will see a period of doubts and even adjustments of some magnitude. We see very complicated that the central banks turn radically in their restrictive positioning of the last months as long as the inflation remains substantially above the objective levels. Likewise we see very unlikely that the current levels of prices can moderate substantially without seeing simultaneously a deterioration of the activity, consumption and investment, which we believe will end up coming. Regarding the fund for the time we prefer to maintain a prudent position because even that it is very difficult to find the appropriate timing, we think very likely that we will see a according to half of the most complicated exercise and with greater uncertainty for the risk assets. We keep a clear underweight in variable income and fixed income positioning focused to the high quality credit in short periods. We still think that increasing the sensitivity of the comparison in excess durations does not compensate the risk. With all we will take advantage of the short positions and we find ourselves in the long-terms.
V01914118;. a) The manager/society’s vision of the market situation. When we started the year 2022 we thought it would be the year of recovery after the pandemic. However, with the invasion of Ukraine, energy prices skyrocketed and inflation rose to levels not seen since the 1970s. The central banks panicked and accelerated the rate hikes causing a strong economic slowdown. If anything, China opted to contain the pandemic with a very restrictive policy (Covid-Zero) preventing the normalization of global supplies and slowing both the growth of its economy and the global one. However, the economies have remained afloat and the recession has been avoided. The markets, which at first discounted a strong recession, have recovered in the final part of the year part of the lost in the face of the resistance of the economies. LIERDE’s portfolio, composed by companies leading in the sector with an opportunity for growth and generating value to shareholders, end the year with a profitability of -10.2% and a creation of value (Increacerment of the book value per share + Profitability per dividend), demonstrating the 13% of the strength of the sector with an industrial advantage of 28% and generating value of the sector with a factor of the 18%., 4) Health 13%, 5) Urbanism and Infrastructures 14% and 6) Leisure/ E-commerce 10%. It is estimated that the current portfolio will have a creation of value for the next years of double digit, being optimistic regarding the expected profitability for 2023, whose behavior should reflect the creation of value of that year. b) General investment decisions adopted. During the fourth quarter, on the side of the purchases, have been sought high quality companies with attractive prices. For this reason, three companies have been incorporated into the portfolio that we analyzed for a long time. We believe that both by valuation and at the moment it is interesting to start positions. On the side of the sales, we have settled the position in two companies because we believe that both have reached their objective price. c) Index of reference. Stoxx 600 Net Return. d) Evolution of the Heritage, participated, profitability and expenses of the IIC. LIERDE FI closed the fourth quarter of the year with a profitability of +8.2% compared to a +14.3% of the Eurostoxx 50 and a fourth impact of the Stoxx 600 (Net Return). The value of the year was not included., 6%. (e) Performance of the fund compared to the other funds of the manager. In addition to Lierde Equities F.I. a pension fund and a sicav are managed, all follow the same investment strategy. Lierde sicav closed the year with a return of -10.2%. 2.;. a) Concrete investments made during the period. Regarding the evolution of the portfolio, during the fourth quarter we have incorporated three companies and we have sold two. On the side of the purchases, we have built a position in Gerresheimer, leading German company in the manufacture of packaging for the pharmaceutical sector both glass and plastic, as well as inhalers, insulin pencils, vials and syringes. The new management team launched a new strategic plan in 2019 focused on growth (+6/+9% per year until 2025) and improvement of efficiency with important investments that are already beginning to be reflected in the results with increases in sales and double-digit profits. We enter the Swiss industrial company Bucher Industries. It is a family-leading global company in the development of technologies and equipment for the agricultural machinery sectors, hydraulic components, equipment for the manufacture of glass, municipal cleaning vehicles and machinery for the beverage sector (wine, fruit, etc.). We particularly like the agricultural business (Kuhn Group) and the equipment for glass manufacturing (Emhart Glass) because of the strong potential company has started in December., The company is benefiting from two structural trends in the industry such as the outsourcing of manufacturing and the approach to Europe of manufacturing processes. The growth of the business allows strong efficiency gains so that the companies that grow the most, as is the case with Note, are immersed in a virtuous circle in which the greatest volume of manufacturing leads them to gain new contracts and feedback growth and profitability. Note that they will be able to grow in sales at least +10% per year during the next few years more purchases. On the side of the sales, we have sold the entire position in the French technology consultant Aubay that we had in portfolio since 2020. It is an excellent company, but after the increases of the last weeks the price has adjusted to our valuation. We also sold the entire position in the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche that we held in portfolio since 2018. The disappointment in the drug against Alzheimer (Gantenerumab) recently announced has been a major setback for the company. To this stage we have recently made an excellent development., But we see more potential in other health sector companies such as Fresenius in which we have been gaining weight in recent weeks. The companies that have contributed most positively to the fund during the fourth quarter of 2022 have been: Duerr, Neurones, Richemont and Andritz. On the contrary, the ones that have contributed most negatively have been: Marlowe, Amazon, Alphabet and FlatexDegiro. b) Securities lending operation. N/A. c) Derivatives operation and temporary asset acquisition. N/A. d) Other investment information. N/A. 3.;. N/A.;. The volatility of LIERDE in the last twelve months is 17.5% compared to 23.4% of Eurostox 50 and 19.0% of Stoxx 600. 5.;. LIERDE FI’s portfolio is composed of companies that are leading in its sector with an opportunity for growth and generate value for shareholders. We currently consider that the generation of average portfolio value for the coming years is going to be double digit.
V01920859;. a) The manager’s view of the market situation. During the first half of 2023, the market has kept the focus on some of the uncertainties that marked the previous year, such as inflation, the restrictive policy of the central banks and the impact that it could have on the evolution of the economy. The year started with strong increases in the markets, both fixed income and variable, animated by the positive expectations of China’s reopening and some moderation in inflation thanks to lower energy prices. This optimism was broken in March after the bankruptcy of two medium American banks, SVB and Signature Bank, and later First Republic, which ended up being bought by JP Morgan. All of them collapsed due to the poor management of their balance sheet before a strong withdrawal of deposits, causing them to sell part of their portfolio of bonds in the long term, which led to the flourishing losses resulting from a lower valuation in the face of strong interest rates. On the European side, the nervousness came from the hand of Credit Suisse. The entity carried out for several years without a delicate situation, which led to be sold at a point of bankruptcy., The fact that financial institutions have much higher solvency and liquidity ratios than in the 2008 crisis, together with the rapid intervention of regulators, caused the 12th situation in March to become a shock. From a macroeconomic point of view, over the course of the six months we have seen some volatility in some of the data published against market expectations. After starting the year with some strength, the majority of activity indicators have been moderated or even weakened and point to a slowdown in the economy.Inflation, although still at high levels, has reflected some relaxation in the main developed economies thanks to lower energy prices and a more comparable base.However, it is still high enough, especially that underlying the services sector and the labour market, so that central banks remain under pressure not to relax interest rates rise or that these remain high for a longer time than estimated.In this sense, we have seen that the US CPI slowed down to 4 per cent in May, after having had records of 9.1 per cent in June, we have kept the rate high at 20 per cent in June., the CPI accumulates seven months of deceleration and is at 6.1%, after the peak of 10.6% in October last year, although the underlying one is still anchored in high levels, 5.3% in May. It highlights the particular situation in the United Kingdom where inflation remains persistent due to Brexit. The data of personal consumption prices CPE in the United States, the price variable most monitored by the EDF, has also been falling during the year, both the general and the underlying. Among the activity data it highlights the evolution that have had the MIPs ́manufacturing, which despite being at levels of contraction at the beginning of the year, did show some improvement in the first two months in Europe and until May in the United States. The data has been falling since then, to levels of 44.8 in the case of the European and up to 48.4 in the American, below the 50 points that separates the expansion of the contraction in the sector. In the case of the services sector, it has continued to show strength and evolution in a positive way, although it was somewhat weaker in the last data published., During the semester, one of the sources of uncertainty has been the limit of the debt ceiling in the United States, of 31.4 trillion dollars reached in January. Again, we have attended the agreement to raise it almost in-extremis, thus avoiding restrictions until January 2025. On the other hand, China, which was one of the growth engines that were expected this year and which showed activity data in the first quarter above what was expected, has deteriorated and we have seen how its industrial activity weakened, which has led the Chinese authorities to introduce slight stimulus measures continuously in the last weeks of the semester.With all this environment, central banks have remained firm in their decision on a restrictive monetary policy although they have been showing caution in the messages transmitted in their appearances, pointing to the fact that they will follow very closely the data to make future decisions on interest rates. Indeed, in the last statements held at the Sintra meeting we have seen how the monetary authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have foreseen further increases in the interest rates in their road map, if they have reached the end of the last 40 months, if they had reached the end of interest in the 40 months., It has increased the reference rates by 25 basis points in 3 of the 4 meetings held during the semester, to 5%-5.25% from the 4.25%-4.5.5% with those that began the year. In the case of the European Central Bank, it increased rates in the four meetings held, passing the interest rate of the main financing operations from 2.5% at the beginning of the year to 4% at the last meeting in June. The Bank of England has followed the same pattern going from 3.5% in December to 5% after the increase in the June meeting. In the European fixed income markets the tone has been spread according to the stretch of the curve. In sovereign debt, although the short sections have expanded in the face of the expectations of interest rates rise, translating in decline in the prices of the bonds, the longer sections have narrowed slightly, maintaining the inverted curve with the rates to 2 years above those of 10 years. Thus the profitability of the German bond to 2 years has closed in June at 3.19%, compared to 2.74 % at the close of 2022 and the Spanish bond has done so in 3.47 %, from the previous 2.89 % to the basic rates., the only country of the European continent together with Sweden to see price falls in the bond to 10 years. In the case of Spain, it is situated at levels of 3.38%, 4.07% in Italy and 2.4% in Germany compared to 3.65%, 4.7% and 2.57%, respectively at the end of 2022. On the credit side, the spreads have been reduced both in bonds with investment grade, with price increases close to 2%, as well as the high yield debt, with price increases of around 5%. Although the year started with optimism, the situation happened with the American regional banks and with the situation of Credit Suisse strained the market in March, causing heavy losses in some assets. However, once the situation has subsided the assets have recovered much of the previous levels. In the United States, the profitability of the bond to 2 years has recapped up to 4.9% compared to 4.4% at the end of the previous year and the bond to 10 years has closed the semester in similar levels, 3.84 % compared to 3.87 %. This makes the slope invert in -105 points basics, it has reached the increase of the year-80 % and the year-old in the year-years., The majority of the movement took place at the beginning of the year, faced with greater optimism about the possible recovery offered by China and expectations of interest rate cuts even though the message of the monetary authorities was restrictive. On the business side, after the presentation of results of the first quarter it was confirmed that the companies are supporting the scenario where we find ourselves better than expected. Overall, they continue to show quite healthy balances with practically maximum business margins. If there is an index that has been highlighted has been Nasdaq 100, with a revalorization of 38.75 per cent, presenting the best first semester in 40 years. The main reason for their good behavior responds to the strong increases that are registering some of the companies with greater weight in the index before a publication of results better than expected and the boom of artificial intelligence. Thus, for example Nvidia, one of the world leaders in chip making, led their estimates of revenues extraordinaryly, 52 per cent above what the market expected for the strong demand that was in artificial intelligence. Thus, for example, 24% of the world leaders in chip manufacturing, it increased their estimate of revenues, 52% above what the high level of the market was in terms of technology., It also surprised the Japanese Nikkei Nikkei with an increase of 27%. On the European side, highlights the Italian Ftse MIB with an increase of 19%, the Eurostoxx 50 (16%) or the Ibex-35 (16.6%). They were slightly more backward the CAC 40 French (14%), the PSI 20 (3.4%), the Swiss market (5%), like the United Kingdom (1%) or the Emerging MSCI (3.5%). Analyzing the sectoral evolution, they highlight the good behavior of leisure and tourism (26.3%), retail (25.8%) and technology (25.3%). On the contrary, the field of basic resources (-13.8%), real estate (-11%) and energy (-4.3%) have been the ones that have behaved the worst after the good 2022 fall, except the real estate that follows the pandemic before the changes of habit in the work and the hardening of the cost of financing.In the currency, the volatility has persisted in the euro that has evolved in the period of 1.052-1 year,106, according to the central and declarations 1,9 % of the interest in the case of the euro has been reduced in the first place of the first place and the first year., (b) General investment decisions adopted. Although we are in one of the highest cycles of monetary tightening in history, economies have slowed down less than expected, blurring the risk of recession after the beginning of the year. This has favoured the upward movement of stock exchanges and narrowing of fixed income, especially private fixed income and to a lesser extent in the long tranches of sovereign debt. Therefore, during the six months, we have maintained the weight through funds with geographically diversified portfolios and sustainable thematic investments. In fixed income, taking advantage of the return on all euro area assets in medium terms, and continuing with our commitment to sustainability criteria, we have increased the weight in green 14 bonds through both the purchase of public and private issuers., For this we have sold several IICs with degree of investment and maturities less than the year and we have reduced the weight in government debt in the short term. c) Index of reference. The management takes as reference the profitability of the index 30% MSCI World Total Return EUR + 40% Bloomberg Barclays series- E Euro Govt 1-5yr Index + 15% Bloomberg Barclays Pan-European Agggregate Corporate 1-3yr Total Return+ 15% Bloomberg Barclays Pan-European High Yield (Euro) TR Index Value. The usefulness of the index is to illustrate to the participant about the potential risk of its investment in the fund, because it is a representative index of the behavior of the securities or markets in which it invests the fund without being limited the investment to them and/or its components. However, the profitability of the fund will not be determined by the revaluation of that index. Specifically, in the period the profitability of the fund, in its portfolio class, has been of 4,47% and 3,5% in its standard class, compared to 4,99%., 08% to 19,990 in the standard class. The profitability of the fund, in its portfolio class, has been 4.47% and 3.8% in its standard class. The minimum profitability of the fund, calculated daily in the last semester, has been -0.69% in the portfolio class and -0.70% in the standard and maximum class of 0.76%, in both classes. The total expenses borne by the fund in the portfolio class were 0.37% broken down between 0.19 % of indirect costs and 0.18% of direct expenses. In its standard class the expenses were 0.97%, broken down between 0.20% indirect and 0.77% direct. The liquidity of the fund has been paid at an average rate of 2.19%. e) Fund performance compared to the rest of the fund manager. During the period, the average profitability of the funds managed by the Management Society of the same category has been 4.76 %, higher than that of the fund. 2.;"(a) Concrete investments made during the period. At the end of June, the distribution of the portfolio is as follows: 34.24% is invested in equities, a percentage higher than in the previous period, 62% in fixed income compared to 68% in December and the rest in liquidity. 25.06% of the equities are funds that invest in variable income with a global geographical scope, 7% in European variable income and the rest in US variable income. On the other hand, it should be noted that, within the global variable income, 11% of the assets (similar to the previous period) are allocated to sustainable thematic investments, such as companies that offer solutions for access and management of water at the global level, those that invest in technology, welfare, ecology or security or in sectors related to nutrition, especially those dedicated to improving the quality, accessibility and sustainability of food production. Within the fixed income, the portfolio is mainly focused on funds that invest mainly in the euro area with a weight of 52% and 10% in global fixed income. The investment is distributed among public issuers, private issuers and IICs that combine both types of assets., {'translation_text': ""4% (3% more than at 31 December) in investments in green bonds that correspond to investments with commitments to support projects in favour of the environment, social bonds (investments that seek to generate positive social results) and sustainable bonds (the combination of the two previous ones).The fund maintains a portfolio of fixed income assets with an average duration of 1.86 years, similar to that of the previous period and an average gross IRR at market prices of 3.97% compared to 3.45 % of the previous period.For the purposes of the investments in portfolio Fitch, Moody's and S&amp;P have maintained the rating of the Kingdom of Spain in A-, Baa1 and A, respectively; the three with stable outlook.In Portugal, without changes for S&amp;P and Fitch in BBB+ (table) and for Moody's in Baa2 who has improved the rating of the country last May from stable to positive.The three main rating agencies, Fitch, Moody's and S&amp;P have maintained the 15 rating of Germany in AAA, Aa2 and AAA respectively, Aa and AAA, with a stable perspective.""}, We have continued to renew the green issues of Grenergy promissory notes. We have subscribed a new IIC, Eurizon Green Euro Credit, whose portfolio are green bonds of European companies, with degree of investment, that seek to implement environmental projects. On the side of the sales, we have partially reimbursed several European funds of degree of investment and short term, among which we stand out; Allianz Euro Obligations Court Term, Erste Responsible Reserve or Bnp Paribas 6M or of public debt like JP Morgan Euro Government Short Duration, of which we sold all the position. As for the High Yield, we have reduced the weight in a fund whose investments are focused in Nordic countries. In variable income we have increased the position in a fund with bias to American companies; Candriam Sustainable Equity US. By part of the sales, we have reduced the position in global funds, like Allianz Global Sustainability or Dpam Equity World and in an ETF whose portfolio is committed to improve the circular economy with 19% of the strong value of the Europeans., 09%, Mirova Global Sustainable Equity with 11.64% for an average weight of 3.80% and the Dpam Equity World Sustainable fund with 16.24% for an average weight of 1.99%. While the investments that have been deducted are the shares of Acciona Renewable Energies with a fall of -15.27% for an average weight of 0.16 %, the funds RobecoSam Climate Global Bond with - 1.06% for an average weight of 0.67% and Candriam Oncology with -1.44% for a weight of 0.26%. The managers in which the fund maintains the most weight are: Candriam, Bnp Paribas, Natixis, Dpam and Erste. b) Securities lending operation. No securities lending operations have been carried out during the period. c) Operating in derivatives and temporary acquisition of assets. The fund has not made use of derivative instruments during the period and does not maintain positions in derivative instruments. As a consequence of the investment in IICs, the fund had a degree of leveraged during the period. c) Operating in derivatives and temporary acquisitions.";Not applicable.;. As for risk measures, volatility in the six-month period is 3.69%, compared with 3.95% of the volatility of its benchmark for both classes and in the same period. Historical volatility is a risk indicator that gives us some information about the magnitude of the movements that can be expected in the liquidative value of the fund, although it should not be used as a prediction or a maximum loss limit. Likewise, the historical HRV at 30 June has been 3.86% in its standard class and 3.77% in the portfolio class. The HRV indicates the maximum amount that can be lost, with a confidence level of 99 per cent, within 1 month, if the behaviour of the CII is repeated over the last 5 years. 5.;". In the first half of the year, the known activity data have transferred to us the image of a resilient developed economies, which, to a greater or lesser extent, have been able to withstand one of the largest cycles of monetary hardening in history, as well as episodes of financial uncertainty; however, in view of the second semester, the strong increases in official rates accumulated in the last twelve months will begin to weigh in growth.The central banks have cooled the expectations of lower rates for 2024 that have been anticipating the forward rates and have become enthralled in a more hawkish tone, insisting on transferring to the markets the idea of higher rates for much longer, to contain some price records that, although in deceleration, are still far from their objective.In view of the current economic growth, more than the additional increases that could become the ceiling of the types, are the ones already made, those that we estimate will still take between two or three quarters to be reflected in the data; however, given the strength of the labor market and the resistance of the expenditure of the Chinese, we could be able to be faced with an economic slowdown that will continue to a very negative.This is why, in the second half of the year, the diversification and selection of issuers that we carry out are determinants. As for the stock exchanges, the market has risen strongly in this first half, both in absolute and relative terms.From here we are more cautious with the future behavior of the stock exchanges, given the uncertainty about the evolution of the economy and in a scenario of tighter valuations, especially in the US stock market.The key will be the business results; by 2024 we expect them to grow slightly, provided the slowdown 17 economic sector is moderate, although in the rest of Europe we are somewhat cautious and forecast to fall.We will maintain a diversified portfolio geographically and sustainable thematic investments. At the forefront of environmental policy, the drive towards a climate-neutral and sustainable economy by 2050 continues to grow significantly, globally. In this sense and with the aim of building and strengthening the foundations of the EU’s sustainable financing framework, the European Commission has presented, this semester, new packages of measures. Highlighting the Net Zero Industry Act (EU Net Zero Industry Act) whose objective is to promote the use of clean technologies, through fiscal credits for production and state aid. In addition to the European Law on Fundamental Raw Materials to ensure access, recycling and securing supply chains. In the US, the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act is also key, given the support approach to energy transition. Therefore, many companies and investors are guiding their investment policies towards sustainability, as evidenced by the growing size of sustainable assets."
V01953959;. a) The manager/company’s view of the market situation. In view of the rest of the year, we can foresee a reversal to the average in terms of the macro aspect of the market. If the companies sell less and the financing environment becomes complicated, it is a framework of low potential of investments. We could see scares towards the rest of the year, so that maintaining calm and prudence in the face of future falls will be important. b) General investment decisions adopted. The bet remains high quality, that is, high value of the assets. The preference is still government bonds, since, in the long term they remain one of the best options of security. Expanding the investment has been used futures on the BUXL, waiting for a reduced potential of the real interest rates c) Reference index. The profitability of the IIC is -2,09%, below the profitability of the Spanish treasury letter with maturity to a year, that is 1.03%. d) Evolution of the heritage, shareholders, profitability and expenses of the IIC. During the period, the fund’s profitability is -2,09%, below the profitability of the Spanish capital stock price to 3,043,045., 68% on the assets during the period compared to 1.24% in the previous period. e) Fund performance compared to the rest of the funds of the manager. The profitability of the fund obtained in the period of -2.09% is less than the average of the returns of the rest of the funds managed by the manager that is 4,47%. 2.;. a) Concrete investments made during the period. The investment of the period has remained German long-term debt, since when the economic stress begins it could behave better than the peripheral debt. Debts denominated in euros have behaved better. The currency has played an important role in the period, being the most stable euro in period. Given the uncertainty in the market, there has not been a great impact or movement in the profitability of the period. So, there has been stability. b) Operating securities loans. N/A c) Operating in derivatives and temporary acquisition of assets. N/A d) Other information on investments. This fund does not have any assets in dispute nor affected Article 48.1.j. of the RIIC. 3.;. N/A;. The risk assumed by the IIC, measured by the volatility of the liquidative value, is 10 of 12.15%, compared to a volatility of 0.33% of the Spanish treasury letter with maturity of one year. 5.;. In view of the rest of the year, the forecast is that there are no interest rate increases far beyond what we have seen. If the economy continues to deteriorate to the present rite, we will see a need to stimulate the economy by cheapering the money. So an upward position in fixed income could reap the fruits of the potential underlying crisis. The current account of the fund in the deposit institution is ES0802320105010029819431.
V02666501;. (a) Manager/society’s vision of the market situation Global economic activity evolved better than expected in the first half of 2023. This relatively favourable behaviour was made possible by the sharp decline in energy prices, the normalization of supply chains and the strength of labour markets. Support measures implemented by different governments also helped to alleviate the rise in inflation. However, in some regions such as the Eurozone and China, the latest economic indicators have surprised to fall. In fact, the most recent figures published indicate that EMU would be suffering a slight recession, with a GDP contraction of one tenth in both the last quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Inflationary pressures continued to relax as a consequence, mainly, of the decline in energy prices. However, the rest of the components of inflation continued without bending downwards significantly and consistently. In this context, central banks continued to tighten their monetary policies, although slowed the pace., The Federal Reserve decided to maintain the rate of intervention in its monetary policy committee in June. Fixed-income markets suffered a great deal of volatility over the course of the semester. There were times when prices fell due to higher rate rises due to the persistence of inflation and in others, as with the financial turbulence of March, prices recovered as sovereign bonds acted as refuge. In the end, short-term sovereign debt market interest rates rose while the longer-term rates were contained or even experienced falls. Thus, the curves showed levels of investment that were not seen in decades. Specifically, the US bond rate to ten years dropped 4 basis points in the semester to 3.84%, and the German bond rate dropped 18 basis points to 2.39%. On the contrary, the two-year bonds showed increases in IRR from +47 basis points to 4.9% in the US and from +43 basis points to 3.20% in Germany. The risk premiums for peripheral debt evolved favourably despite the context of volatility and the beginning of the ECB’s core risk reduction process was reduced by 10 basis points in Spain., The main stock indexes recorded important increases in the semester. The MSCI World index of developed countries rose +14.0% and the MSCI Emerging index, +3.5%. The Eurostoxx50 began the year highlighting favorably in relation to the rest of indexes but then, with the boost of the values related to Artificial Intelligence, the American stock exchange recovered ground and the semi-annual balances were equalled (Eurostoxx50 +16.0%, S&P500 +15.9%). 15 Within the European stock exchange, the sectors that behaved best in the semester were travel and leisure (+26.2%), distribution (+25.6%) and technology (+25.3%). There were three sectors that closed the semester in negative: raw materials (- 13.8%), real estate (-11.1%) and oil companies (-4.4%). The banking sectoral indexes closed the semester in lower levels than those recorded before the episode of financial turbulence that took place in March following the collapse of the American bank Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse. In contrast, the Japanese currency cycles, the most notable to the depreciation to the decline of the economics (12% of the economics of the year before the economics (1., In the market of raw materials the most prominent was the sharp fall in the price of gas (European reference -50%) as well as of oil (Brent -13%). b) General decisions of investment adopted. The Bankinter fund index Health FI has remained invested during the period around 100% in futures and ETFs on the topic of Global Health. The percentage invested in other institutions of Collective Investment (IICs) represents 91.11% of the patrimony at the end of the period through a different ETfs on the underlying index (Lyxor, X trackers, iShares, State Street). c) Index of reference. The management of the fund is linked to its index of reference. At the end of the period, the linear correlation of the fund with its index of reference has been of 0,87. The tracking error period has been of 5.08 %, compared to its index inferior to the indicated in its information leaflet. d) Evolution of the fund, participations, profitability and expenses of the IIC. The patrimony of the class R has varied in -14,29% while the period of the class A in -21,64%., 42% to the expenses of the own class R fund and -0.1% to the indirect expenses for investment in other funds. During the period, the current expenses borne by class A have had an impact of -0.42% on their profitability, corresponding to -0.32% to the expenses of the own class A fund and -0.10% to the indirect costs for investment in other funds. The average return on liquidity during the period has been 0.83%. e) Performance of the fund compared to the rest of the funds of the manager. N/A 2.;. a) Concrete investments made during the period. During the period we have maintained the investment of the fund through derivatives and ETFS referenced to the benchmark. We have used the following investment instruments: Xtrackers MSCI World Health care UCITS ETF Lyxor MSCI World Health care TR UCITS ETF iShares MSCI World Health care Sector UCITS ETF SPDR MSCI World health Care UCITS ETF Lyxor Stoxx Europe 600 Healthcare UCITS These instruments have contributed in a very similar way to the profitability of the fund. b) Securities lending operation. N/A c) Derivatives operation and temporary asset acquisition. The fund has carried out during the period future sales operations on health indices. The result of the 16 investment in these transactions has resulted in a return of -0.2 per cent on the average assets of the fund. The derivative investment strategy has sought at all times to give a return similar to that of the benchmark. d) Other information on investments. N/A 3.;. N/A;. The average level of leverage in derivatives during the period has been 80.79% and the volatility of the liquidative value of the fund has been 10.19%, volatility similar to that of the benchmark over the same period. 5.;. The rapid and intense tightening of monetary policy at global level should have a negative impact on activity during the second half of 2023. In turn, such a slowdown in activity should help to moderate inflation. That said, the uncertainty about the evolution of inflation in the next semester remains high. It seems likely that the deinflation process will continue its course by hand of the lowering of raw materials and the dissolution of bottlenecks. However, in the case of prices of services the slowdown could be slow due to the greater weight of the wage component in its cost structure, and because the strength of the demand remains evident in areas such as tourism and leisure. Thus, central banks will have to remain very vigilant and will make some additional increase in interest rates until they have security over the control of inflation. In this sense, it is estimated that the ECB will make two additional increases until the deposit rate is set at 4%. The prospects for the Federal Reserve are not so clear and the consensus will be reached between one or two additional increases (in the latter case the first intervention rate range will be set at 5.7% and the main economic gains will be reached).However, it is waiting for recovery of profits per share in the second half of the year and a disappointment could occur in that sense. The multiple valuations of the exchanges are at demanding levels in the US and in line with their historical average in Europe. Moreover, the relative to the fixed income is becoming more unfavourable for the variable income. In this context it seems reasonable to think that the most defensive and quality values will show a better performance. Probably, the fixed income assets will continue to show a high volatility since the end of the cycle of increases by the central banks seems to have postponed. Therefore, the fixed income will continue to suffer swings according to the expectations regarding the evolution of the interest rates of the major global central banks that, in turn, will change in response to the publication of the indicators of activity and of prices. Despite the good performance relative to the semester, we think that the private fixed income will continue to show 17 attractive to the sovereign bonds, especially the financial debt.
V02666600;. a) The manager’s vision of the market situation The current situation in the first half of the year 2023 has continued to be marked by the evolution of the war in Ukraine, the serious problems suffered by the American bank and the increase in interest rates. Central banks have continued to increase the price of money, although it has shown a slowdown in the increases. The EDF has already brought interest rates to 5.25% while the ECB is still behind, at 3.50%. During the month of March, the American regional bank suffered very significant outflows of deposits, causing a panic that led to the bankruptcy of several of them and the contagion of Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank was acquired by UBS following the intervention of the regulator. Inflation has been showing the first signs of relaxation towards the end of the period. The tightening of the financial conditions is already having its impact on the economies. The European economy entered into a technical recession by showing two quarters followed by negative growth data. However, the central banks have not yet given their arm to twist and maintain a hard discourse, anticipating further rise of rates in the future., 57%, 15.96% and 15.91% respectively. The raw materials have shown a clear decline, in part due to the early economic slowdown. The price of crude oil fell by 12.82 %, closing the period at $74.90 per barrel of Brent. The price of copper had a good start of the year, but it gave up everything in the second quarter, closing the period with a fall of -1,69%. Most of the sectors showed an important revaluation during the first half of 2023. Those that showed the best behavior were the tourism sector, for the recovery in the travels, and the retail sector. The raw materials and real estate sector suffered double-digit falls. The investment philosophy of Santalucía Grandes Companies Euro Zone is to have a maximum presence and exposure to the large European companies maintaining a high level of investment in variable income. 22 (b) General investment decisions adopted We maintain a stable portfolio and closely monitor the subscriptions and refunds to adjust the portfolio and the level of investment. During the first semester the fund has bought and sold futures of Eurostoxxx 50 with the objective of maintaining a 100% variable income exposure., Following the investment objective stipulated in its brochure. During the period there have been no changes in the rating. c) Reference index. The fund SL Large Companies Euro Zone had a behavior in line with its index of reference during the second semester. The reference index is Morningstar Eurozone 50 Net Return which obtained a +18.71%. The fund had against the index a higher return in Class A of 0.04%, in Class B lower by -0.76%, in Class C lower by -0.32%, in Class AR lower by -0.08%, in Class BR lower by -0.87% and in Class CR higher by 0.07%. The behavior is similar because the composition of the portfolio is very similar to that of the reference index. The difference is due to the fact that the fund has had a level of investment slightly less than 100%. This reference index is used for information and/or comparative purposes only. d) Evolution of the Heritage, participants, profitability and expenses of the IIC 108. The fund closed the period with a total equity of €5.571 thousand to €3., 59 % going from 17 thousand euros to 29 thousand euros. In the AR class there was an increase of 16.83 % going from 1.028 thousand euros to 1.201 thousand euros. In the BR class there was an increase of 16.67 % going from 6 thousand euros to 7 thousand euros. The CR class remains at 10 euros. The number of shareholdings at 31/12/2022 and at the end of the period are respectively 4 and 4 for Class A. 36 and 50 for Class B. 62 and 66 for Class C. 1 and 1 for Class AR. 3 and 3 for Class BR. 1 and 1 for the CR class. The profitability obtained by the fund in the period has been 18.75% for Class A, from 17.95% for Class B, from 18.39% for Class C, from 18.63% for Class AR, from 17,84% for the BR class and from 18.78% for the CR class. The accumulated expenses supported by the fund include the management commission for Class C, from 18.39% for Class C, from 18.69% for Class A, from 0,02% for Class B., The percentage corresponding to the deposit commission will be applied to the entire assets of the fund, then assigning the amount corresponding to each class of participation, in proportion to its assets. e) Performance of the fund compared to the rest of the funds of the manager. As for the comparison the average profitability of the manager in the period has been 6,99%. Funds of the same category Variable Euro Income managed by Santalucia Asset Management SGIIC, S.A.U. had an average profitability of 12,29% in the period. 2.;. a) Concrete investments made during the period. We have managed the receipts/outputs of the fund by purchasing/selling through the purchase/sale of futures on the Eurostoxx. The values that most have contributed in profitability during the semester have been shares of ASML Holding NV, SAP SE, Schneider Electric, Futures on the Eurostoxx and Ferrari NV shares while those that have remained the most have been shares of Anheuser-Busch Inbev, Deutsche Telekom, Kering and Bayer. 23 The fund does not have investments of those included in Article 48.1.j. The fund has not invested in structured products. b) Transaction of securities for the purpose of investment. N/A c) Transaction of derivatives and temporary acquisition of assets. The fund applies the commitment methodology for all the derivative instruments with which it operates, both of coverage and of investment. During the reference period, the IIC has not operated with instruments derived for the purpose of investment The fund has carried out derivatives operations in the period, but not of temporary acquisition of assets. The purpose of these operations was aimed to the exposure to the market of securities to the future IIC (EUR) should be considered to the investment., 55% on future assets over the Eurostoxx. The nominal amount committed is €797.00000. The average level of leverage of the fund, according to the derivative commitment method, has been 10,04% during the period. d) Other investment information There is no default value, nor litigation. There are no defaults occurring at the date of the report The portfolio turnover rate and the average annualized liquidity return have been during the period of 0.00% and 2.43% respectively. 3.;. N/A;The annualized volatility of the fund (under historical volatility the risk of a value over a period, with greater volatility higher risk) has been higher than that of its benchmark, being 15%, while that of the index has been 14.82 per cent. The fund has had a portfolio similar to that of its benchmark, because the investment portfolio is practically the same as that of the benchmark. The historical RAV of the portfolio indicates the maximum that can be lost, with a confidence level of 99%, within 1 month, if the behavior of the CII of the last 5 years is repeated. The cumulative RAV is 10.77 per cent for Class A, 10.89 per cent for Class B, 10.82 per cent for Class C, 10.3% for Class AR, 11.14% for Class BR and 10.0 per cent for Class CR. 5.;. The gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus measures, the normalization of interest rates, the possible slowdown in economies and the increase in geopolitical tension leads us to believe that volatility will remain high during the year. However, and as a result of the impossibility of forecasting market behaviour, active portfolio management will continue to take advantage of taking new positions or increasing existing ones in case investment opportunities materialize. No significant changes in investment levels are anticipated.The perspectives contained in this report should be considered as views of the Manager, who are susceptible to change.
V02746964;. a) The manager’s view of the market situation. In the 1T of 2023, the US Treasury’s return initially decreased in January due to the expectation that inflation has reached its peak, then recovered in February, as inflation data seem higher than expected by the market. In March, the focus was on the weakness of the financial system following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States and the depreciation of the Credit Suisse AT1 paper in Switzerland. Consequently, the short-term UST recovered as markets took into account the inflation narrative. UST’s return to 2 years was reduced by 40 pb in the quarter to 4.02%, and the return of UST to 10 years ended the quarter approximately 41 pb lower by 3.46%. The reversal of the curve continues as the market expects the US economy to slow down in the year. On the credit side, the JP Morgan Asia Credit Hedge to EUR Index (JACI Hedged EUR China) benchmark was regressive by 1.85% for the quarter, with 1⁄2% for the year., The short sales attack against Adani’s companies and the weakness of US banking triggered the feeling of risk. During the 1Q 2023, JACI’s general differential level 14 expanded 10 basis points to 301 basis points. b) General investment decisions adopted. The retail class GVC Asian Income Fund generated a return of 0.80% on 1Q 2023, below the profitability of 1.85% of its benchmark JACI Hedge EUR. The low return was mainly due to its exposure to USD currencies, which weakened by 1.92% against EUR during the quarter. We estimate that holdings of bonds in USD in the portfolio generated between 2.4% and 2.7% of total return for the 1Q 2023 excluding the impact of foreign exchange. A large part of the profitability comes from the coupon, given the high return of the portfolio of around 8% throughout the quarter. Within holdings, long-term investment grade bonds and good quality Chinese real estate bonds had the best performance during the month, while the financial role came from the portfolio, given the high return of the portfolio of around 8% over the entire quarter., Australia and Indonesia. The portfolio has 13% of High Yield, reduced since the level of 17% of the previous quarter, as we position ourselves more defensively with the expectation of a possible recession in the United States. The high-yield weight to 13% is also slightly underweight compared to the weight of 15% in the JACI index. The weighted yield of the portfolio is 8.0%, slightly less than 8.1% of the previous quarter, since we reduced the allocation to the high-yield sector during the quarter. We continue to invest mainly with cash to less than 5% of the liquid value, since we believe that the high carry is a good cushion to the volatility of the credit differential. In terms of duration positioning, we maintained the duration of the portfolio around 4.2 years, as we remain constructive in terms of interest rates. c) Reference index. The IIC is actively managed according to its objectives and investment policy, so that its management is not linked or limited by any benchmark. The net return of the IIC in the period has been 0.07%., The net return of the IIC during the period has been 0.07%, with a total impact of the expenses incurred in the same period of 0.49%. e) Performance of the fund in comparison with the rest of the funds of the manager. The IIC has obtained a net return in the period of 0.07%, in turn during the same period the total of funds managed by GVC Gaesco Gestión SGIIC, S.A. has recorded an average return during the period of 5.14%. In the table of paragraph 2.2.B) of the report, you can consult the average return of the accumulated funds in function of its management vocation. 2.;. a) Concrete investments made during the period. In the part movements in portfolio has only been made a sale of the bond of Oman that had behaved very well. There has been no purchases. The portfolio has had a worse performance to the market in which it is invested by the currency that has diminished positive profitability this quarter because it is not covered and has such an important weight. The bonds that have behaved worse have been ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance, AAC TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING and National bank of Kwait. On the positive side we highlight Country garden, Indonesia Aluminium and Newcastle Coal Infrastructure . No derivatives have been used. The assets that have contributed greater profitability in the period have been: CHOVS GRAND OCE FINANCE 2.45% 9/2/26, NEWCASTLE COAL INFRASTRUC 4.7% 12/5/31, XIAOMI 4.1% 14/07/51, INDONESIA ASAHAN ALUMINI 5.8% 15/5/50, DUA CAPITAL HONHO8%, 11/5/31. The assets that have subtracted from the operating profitability in the period, (d) Other investment information: As regards structured products, assets in dispute or assets included in Article 48.1j of the RIIC, the IIC does not possess any. 3.;. N/A;. The Volatility of the IIC in the period has been 10.46%. In the same period the reference index has recorded a volatility of 9.96%. The VaR from end of period to one month with a confidence level of 99%, is 11.58%. GVC Gaesco Management SGIIC analyzes the depth of the market of the securities in which the IIC invests, considering the usual negotiation and the volume invested. Under normal conditions it would take 5 days to liquidate 90% of the invested portfolio. 5.;. The market has now shifted to greater concern over the prolonged impact of the aggressive cycle of rate hikes on banking systems and businesses and the riddle of the Fed policy between inflation and market stability. Furthermore, again we face multiple credit rating reductions in the real estate sector of China due to the delay in the recovery of property sales and liquidity still adjusted while maturity of bonds and loans is coming. Markets are also valuing the risks and volatility given the multiple major risks and geopolitical uncertainties we have experienced in just one quarter. While the overall yields of the bonds continue to appear attractive, the current credit spreads are only a little above the average of the last 5 years and seem adjusted if we want to discount the increasing risks of recession. Therefore, we prefer to keep the defensive rates in the 2T2023 until we look at the bond markets on a more stable basis. We remain positive on the USD bonds with a longer-term perspective. The US Federal Reserve should slow down the year-to-rates of interest rates in the second half of 2023 and inflation could increase if the second half of 2023.We would overweight and extend the duration in investment grade bonds and sovereign bonds, while we would underweight high-performance bonds. We may have some short-term high-performance bonds for carry.
V02747046;. 12 a) The manager’s vision of the market situation. The beginning of the year in the main equity markets has been very good, especially in the European squares when recording double-digit returns. For the time being, the much-announced recession does not act of presence, quite the contrary, in which the main indicators of activity, both macroeconomic and microeconomic, continue to show signs of strength. In this sense, consumer confidence continues at high levels, reflecting in the services sector that continues to expand. At the business level, the margins remain very strong, as they maintain or increase their price policy in a scenario of clear slowdown in the prices of raw materials and transport. At the monetary level, the respective Central Banks and led by the US Federal Reserve, maintained their efforts to reduce inflation by continuing with their expansionary monetary policy, without losing the focus on their objective despite the bank shock with the bankruptcy of SVB and the purchase of Credit Suisse fund by UBS. In the foreign exchange market, the euro dollar crossed virtually unchanged, by closing the quarter in the 1,08 dollars. b) 26% of the general income has a mixed income., During this quarter we have maintained a total exposure of 7% of the portfolio in direct shares and equity investment funds 19%. During the quarter we have made cover through the sale of futures in the different markets: EUROSTOXX 50 has covered 33% of the exposure, S&P 500 20% and NASDAQ 100 another 30% of the exposure. Within the variable income has been invested in EURO zone, in the USA, and Asia, completing with sectoral investments, with the objective of providing the fund with a very diversified strategy. The fixed income and conservative funds will constitute the most important proportion of the portfolio. During the quarter several strategies have been maintained in funds linked to inflation and flexible funds in terms, assets and geographical areas, with preponderance in the euro area to avoid foreign currency risk. Finally, the profitability of the first quarter has been 3.31 %. c) Reference index. The IIC is actively managed according to its objectives and investment policy, so that its period is not linked or limited by any reference period., 99% and the number of participants has recorded a negative variation of -2 participants, which represents a variation of -1,87%. The net return of the IIC during the period has been 3,31%, with a total impact of the expenses incurred in the same period of 0.51%. GVC Gaesco Blue Chips RFMI, FI, invests more than 10% in other IICs and therefore satisfies management rates in the IICs of the portfolio. The indirect costs supported by the investment in other IICs during the period amount to 0.09% of the average assets of the IIC. e) Performance of the fund compared to the rest of the funds of the manager. The IIC has obtained a net return in the period of 3.31%, in turn during the same period the group of funds managed by GVC Gaesco Gestión SGIIC, S.A. has recorded an average return during the period of 5.14%. In the table of paragraph 2.2.B) of the report, the average performance of the funds accumulated in function of its managerial vocation can be consulted. 2.;. a) Concrete investments made during the period. During the quarter we have added new companies such as: Allianz, Repsol and Telefonica. During the quarter futures have been bought and sold on Nasdaq, S&P and Eurostoxx, and Volatildad. The assets that have contributed greater profitability in the period have been: META PLATFORMS CLASS A, APPLE COMPUTER INC, AXA WORLD GLOBAL INFLATION BONDS AA SICAV, ALLIANZ EUROPE EQUITY GROUP SICAV, ROBECO SAM ENERGY EQUITIES I SICAV. The assets that have subtracted greater profitability in the period have been: 13 JPMORGAN US VALUE EUR FUND, JANUS HENDERSON GLB LIFE SCIENCES FUND, ROBECO CAP GR-NEW WKD FIN-D SICAV. b) Operating assets have not been realized during the operating period of securities loans. c) Operating assets in derivatives and futures, The average leverage of the IIC during the period was 5.95%. The average remuneration obtained by the liquidity maintained by the IIC during the period was 1.9%. d) Other investment information. As regards structured products, disputed assets or assets included in Article 48.1j of the RIIC, the IIC does not possess any. 3.;. N/A;The Volatility of the IIC in the period has been 3.78%. In the same period the reference index has recorded a volatility of 3.71%. The VaR from end of period to one month with a confidence level of 99%, is 4,15%. The beta of GVC GAESCO BLUE CHIPS RFMI, regarding its benchmark, in the last 12 months is 0,35. GVC Gaesco Gestión SGIIC analyzes the depth of the market of the securities in which the IIC invests, considering the usual trading and the volume invested. In normal conditions it would take 1.19 days to liquidate 90% of the invested portfolio. 5.;. Very likely we will continue with high levels of investment in equity income over the coming months given the still mismatch between quotations and valuations, with the aim of maximizing return for Fund members. The typology of companies and geographical selection should result in a clearly higher profitability than that of the market in the long term. 14
V02747087;. a) The manager’s vision of the market situation. The beginning of the year in the main equity markets has been very good, especially in the European squares when recording double-digit returns. For the time being, the much announced recession does not act of presence, rather 9 on the contrary, in which the main indicators of activity, both macroeconomic and microeconomic, continue to show signs of strength. In this sense, consumer confidence continues at high levels, reflecting in the service sector that continues to expand. At the business level, the margins remain very strong, as they maintain or increase their price policy in a scenario of clear slowdown in the prices of raw materials and transport. At the monetary level, the respective Central Banks and led by the US Federal Reserve, maintained their efforts to reduce inflation by continuing with their expansionary monetary policy, without losing the focus on their objective despite the bank shock with the bankruptcy of SVB and the purchase of Credit Suisse by UBS. In the foreign exchange market, the euro dollar crossed virtually unchanged, when they close the quarter in the 1.08 dollars. b) The mixed income fund has 67% on the capital income., In investment funds the exposure of the total portfolio is 71% of which the equity balance accounts for 53% of the total portfolio.

Covers have been made through the sale of futures in the different markets: EUROSTOXX 50 has been covered 24% of the exposure, S&P 500 30% and NASDAQ 100 30% of the exposure. Within the variable income has been invested in EURO area, in the USA and Asia, complementing with sectoral investments, with the objective of providing the fund with a highly diversified strategy. During the quarter the fixed income and conservative funds of the portfolio have been maintained in various strategies: funds linked to inflation and flexible funds in terms of time, assets and geographical areas, with preponderance in the euro area to avoid currency risk. Finally, the profitability of the first quarter has been 5,07%. c) Index of reference.

In normal conditions it would take 0.93 days to liquidate 90% of the invested portfolio. 5.;. Very likely we will continue with high levels of investment in equity income over the coming months given the still mismatch between quotations and valuations, with the aim of maximizing return for 11 Fund members. The typology of companies and geographical selection should result in a clearly higher profitability than that of the market in the long term.
V02753879;In the first half of 2023, the market has kept the focus on some of the uncertainties that marked the previous year, such as inflation, the restrictive policy of the central banks and the impact that this could have on the evolution of the economy. The year started with strong increases in the markets, both fixed income and variable, motivated by the positive expectations of China’s reopening and some moderation in inflation thanks to lower energy prices. This optimism was disrupted in March following the bankruptcy of two medium American banks, SVB and Signature Bank, and later First Republic, which ended up being bought by JP Morgan. All of them collapsed due to the poor management of its balance sheet before a strong withdrawal of deposits, causing them to sell part of their portfolio of bonds in the long term, which led to the flourishing of losses resulting from a lower valuation in the face of strong interest rates. On the European side, the nervousness came from Credit Suisse. The entity had been carrying out a delicate situation for several years without being sold to the point of bankruptcy., The fact that financial institutions have much higher solvency and liquidity ratios than in the 2008 crisis, together with the rapid intervention of regulators, made the situation in March a shock. From a macroeconomic point of view, over the course of the semester we have seen some volatility in some of the 12 published data against market expectations. After starting the year with some strength, the majority of activity indicators have been moderated or even weakened and point to a slowdown in the economy.Inflation, although still at high levels, has reflected some relaxation in the main developed economies thanks to lower energy prices and an easier comparable base.However, it is still high enough, especially that underlying the services sector and the labour market, so that central banks remain under pressure not to relax interest rates rise or that these remain high for a longer time than estimated.In this sense, we have seen the US CPI slow down to 4 per cent in May, after having had records of 9.1 per cent in June, we have kept the rate high at 20 per cent in June., the CPI accumulates seven months of deceleration and is at 6.1%, after the peak of 10.6% in October last year, although the underlying one is still anchored in high levels, 5.3% in May. It highlights the particular situation in the United Kingdom where inflation remains persistent due to Brexit. The data of personal consumption prices CPE in the United States, the price variable most monitored by the EDF, has also been falling during the year, both the general and the underlying. Among the activity data it highlights the evolution that have had the MIPs ́manufacturing, which despite being at levels of contraction at the beginning of the year, did show some improvement in the first two months in Europe and until May in the United States. The data has been falling since then, to levels of 44.8 in the case of the European and up to 48.4 in the American, below the 50 points that separates the expansion of the contraction in the sector. In the case of the services sector, it has continued to show strength and evolution in a positive way, although it was somewhat weaker in the last data published., During the semester, one of the sources of uncertainty has been the limit of the debt ceiling in the United States, of 31.4 trillion dollars reached in January. Again, we have attended the agreement to raise it almost in-extremis, thus avoiding restrictions until January 2025. On the other hand, China, which was one of the growth engines that were expected this year and which showed activity data in the first quarter above what was expected, has deteriorated and we have seen how its industrial activity weakened, which has led the Chinese authorities to introduce slight stimulus measures continuously in the last weeks of the semester.With all this environment, central banks have remained firm in their decision on a restrictive monetary policy although they have been showing caution in the messages transmitted in their appearances, pointing to the fact that they will follow very closely the data to make future decisions on interest rates. Indeed, in the last statements held at the Sintra meeting we have seen how the monetary authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have foreseen further increases in the interest rates in their road map, if they have reached the end of the last 40 months, if they had reached the end of interest in the 40 months., It has increased the reference rates by 25 basis points in 3 of the 4 meetings held during the semester, to 5%-5.25% from the 4.25%-4.5.5% with those that began the year. In the case of the European Central Bank, it increased rates in the four meetings held, passing the interest rate of the main financing operations from 2.5% at the beginning of the year to 4% at the last meeting in June. The Bank of England has followed the same pattern going from 3.5% in December to 5% after the increase in the June meeting. In the European fixed income markets the tone has been spread according to the stretch of the curve. In sovereign debt, although the short sections have expanded in the face of the expectations of interest rates rise, translating in decline in the prices of the bonds, the longer sections have narrowed slightly, maintaining the inverted curve with the rates to 2 years above those of 10 years. Thus the profitability of the German bond to 2 years has closed in June at 3.19%, compared to 2.74 % at the close of 2022 and the Spanish bond has done so in 3.47 %, from the previous 2.89 % to the basic rates. The return of the German bond has increased slightly to 10-27 points in Spain has increased in June, whereas in June p., the only country of the European continent together with Sweden to see falls in prices in the bond to 10 years. In the case of Spain, it is situated in levels of 3.38%, 4.07% in Italy and 2.4% in Germany compared to 3.65%, 4.7% and 2.57%, respectively at the end of 2022. On the credit side, the spreads have been reduced both in 13 bonds with degree of investment, with increases in price close to 2%, as well as the high yield debt, with increases in price of around 5%. Although the year began with optimism, the situation happened with the American regional banks and with the situation of Credit Suisse strained the market in March, causing strong losses in some assets. However, once the situation has subsided the assets have recovered much of the previous levels. In the United States, the profitability of the bond to 2 years has risen up to 4.9% compared to 4.4% at the end of the previous year and the bond to 10 years has closed the semester at similar levels, 3.84 % close to 3.87 %. This makes the slope invert in -105 points basics of credit, it has marked the close to 4.43 % at the year and 10 years and the bond in March., The majority of the movement took place at the beginning of the year, faced with greater optimism about the possible recovery offered by China and expectations of interest rate cuts even though the message of the monetary authorities was restrictive. On the business side, after the presentation of results of the first quarter it was confirmed that the companies are supporting the scenario where we find ourselves better than expected. Overall, they continue to show quite healthy balances with practically maximum business margins. If there is an index that has been highlighted has been Nasdaq 100, with a revalorization of 38.75 per cent, presenting the best first semester in 40 years. The main reason for their good behavior responds to the strong increases that are registering some of the companies with greater weight in the index before a publication of results better than expected and the boom of artificial intelligence. Thus, for example Nvidia, one of the world leaders in chip making, led their estimates of revenues extraordinaryly, 52 per cent above what the market expected for the strong demand that was in artificial intelligence. Thus, for example, 24% of the world leaders in chip manufacturing, it increased their estimate of revenues, 52% above what the high level of the market was in terms of technology., It also surprised the Japanese Nikkei index, with an increase of 27%. On the European side, the Italian MIB Ftse stands out with an increase of 19%, the Eurostoxx 50 (16%) or the Ibex-35 (16.6%). There were slightly more behind the CAC 40 French (14%), the PSI 20 (3.4%), the Swiss market (5%), as well as the United Kingdom (1%) or the Emerging MSCI (3.5%). Analyzing the sectoral evolution, they highlight the good behavior of leisure and tourism (26.3%), retail (25.8%) and technology (25.3%). On the contrary, the basic resource sector (-13.8%), real estate (-11%) and energy (-4.3%) have been the ones that have behaved the worst after the good 2022 period, except the real estate that follows the pandemic before the changes of habit in the work and the hardening of the cost of financing.In the currency, the volatility has persisted in the euro that has evolved in the range of 1,052-1,106 year, according to the actions and declarations of the central banks fall in the case 1., In the end of the semester, most of these companies were domiciled in North America (17 companies in the US with a weight of around 64% and 3 companies in Canada with a weight of about 6%), 8 companies in Europe (with a weight of around 25%) and one company in Taiwan with a weight of 3.5%. In any case, most of the companies in which the fund invests are multinationals. c) Index of reference. Management takes as a reference the index MSCI World Net Return Index EUR, which includes profitability per dividend. 14 The profitability of that index in the semester was 12,58% compared to 21,65% of profitability of Bulnes Class B and 21,35% of Bulnes Class A. The usefulness of the index is to illustrate to the participant the potential risk of its investment in the fund, because it is a representative index of the relative behavior of the securities or markets in which the fund invests without being limited the investment to the same components., 1%, the error tracking is 9.04 and the correlation coefficient of 0.87. d) Evolution of the Heritage, participations, profitability and expenses of the IIC. The assets of the fund at the close of the semester reaches 5,069 thousand euros in its class B, which implies an increase of 23.88% and 7,187 thousand euros in class A, which implies an increase of 21,96%. The number of participants decreases to 54 in class B (-1.82 % compared to the previous period) and 757 in class A (-1.94 % compared to the previous period). Global FI Bulnes has closed June with a liquidative value in its class B of 376,7364 euros, which implies a profitability of 21.65%. In the case of class A, the total expenses supported by the fund in the period were 0.82% for class A and 0.57% for class A. The maximum return achieved for both the fund A and B was 3.49 % while the minimum daily return was -2.06%. The total expenses supported by the fund in the overall period were for class A and 0.57% for class B.;". a) Concrete investments made during the period. The portfolio of the fund in the first half of 2023, contains a selection of high quality companies, from which we expect a yield above the benchmark, maintaining some parameters of quality far above the market. It has continued to invest in the portfolio of companies with which it ended the previous semester. In this semester also has been added Interactive Brokers and Novo Nordisk. On the other hand, it has been sold Pershing Square Holdings, Walt Disney (which did not reach three months), TJX, Lumine Group (the spin-off of Constellation Software whose shares began to be quoted in March of this year) and Estee Lauder. The first group of companies in which it is invested, could be called major global technological companies, being the majority of them domiciled in the USA. It is a group of businesses whose shares have clear competitive advantages and a strong generation of cash: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms (Facebook), Microsoft, Apple, Prosus (Tencent), Masterholding and TSMC have been part of this group with the exception of the company., Thermo Fisher Scientific and Topicus. Another group is formed by investment companies in Private Equity, Real Estate, Infrastructure and other real assets, which are benefiting from over-regulation in the banking sector and the appetite of institutional investors to diversify their investments in other less traditional assets: KKR, Apollo Global Management and Brookfield Corporation. The following group is made up of leading retail companies, with a much higher profitability than the average of the market. Here we include Costco, Tractor Supply, Ross Stores, Floor &amp; Decor and the brands of Adidas and LVHM. The fund also has a pair of home builders, the two of higher quality in their respective markets, Persimmon in the United Kingdom, and NVR in the USA. Within the basic consumption sector, we have led multinationals, bought at very reasonable prices: Philip Morris, Nestlé and Compassss Group. In addition, there is a middle half broker focused on the niche of professionals and institutional investors, Interactivae Brokers, and a leading company of the market for diabetes and obesity., 4%. On the contrary, the main detractors of profitability have been Estee Lauder -20.4% with an average weight of 1.95% (the total of the position has been sold at the end of the semester), Thermo Fisher -5.13% for an average weight of 4%, Persimmon -11.6% for an average weight of 3.46 % and Walt Disney, with a decrease of 5.26% and a weight of 0.94% during the period that has remained in portfolio.If we analyze the contribution sectorally, the sectors that have contributed the most have been discretionary consumption (where we find companies like Amazon or LVMH), followed by technology (with companies such as Microsoft, Apple or Constellation Software) and communications services (Meta or Alphabet).The only sector of which there is a portfolio position that has diminished profitability has been health, because of the position maintained in Thermo Fisher. b) Operating weight of securities loan. No transactions of securities have been carried out during the period. c) Operating in derivatives and temporary acquisition of assets.";Not applicable.;. The risk assumed by the Fund, measured by the volatility of its daily liquidative value, has been 15.44% (both classes), compared to 11.87% of its benchmark in the semester. Historical volatility is a risk indicator that gives us some information about the magnitude of the movements that can be expected in the liquidative value of the fund, although it should not be used as a prediction or a maximum loss limit. The RAV of the fund at 30 June in Class A is 11.24% and in Class B of 10.99%. The RAV indicates the maximum amount that can be lost, with a confidence level of 99 per cent, within 1 month, if the behaviour of the CII of the last 5 years is repeated. 5.;". In the first half of the year, the known activity data have transferred us the image of a resilient developed economies, which, to a greater or lesser extent, have been able to withstand one of the largest cycles of monetary hardening in history, as well as episodes of financial uncertainty; however, in view of the second semester, the strong increases in official rates accumulated in the last twelve months will begin to weigh in growth.The central banks have cooled the expectations of lower rates for 2024 that have been anticipating the forward rates and have become cast in a more hawkish tone, insisting on transferring to the markets the idea of higher rates for much longer, in order to contain some price records that, although in deceleration, are still far from their objective.In view of the economic growth, more than the additional increases that could become to the ceiling of the types, are the ones already made, which we estimate will still take between two or three quarters to be reflected in the data.Although in the rest of 2023 we are somewhat more cautious and we foresee slight falls in profits by companies’ action (greater in the US than in Europe). It will be key to monitor the evolution of companies in the technology sector, while here the increases have been higher and therefore the valuations are higher. That said, the long-term structural growth of this sector remains in place, which is a point in favor to have a structural position. We do not rule out an increase in volatility in the stock exchanges from these levels, which we see as an opportunity to enter more attractive levels. Based on this scenario we will maintain a diversified portfolio, focused on quality companies that are able to create value in the long term, in the case of leading companies at a global level."
V02819647;. a) The manager’s vision of the situation of the markets. The scenario that has been drawn in this first half of 2023 has been marked by an appetite for the noticeable risk against the generalized positioning of strategists and managers of the closing of 2022. Even, the episodes of volatility that have occurred (the debt ceiling in the US, the crisis of the medium banks in the US,...) have had a limited duration and impact. It is worth reviewing the macroeconomic frame of reference to deepen the explanation of the behavior of the markets and different agents. Inflation and central banks. Throughout the semester we have seen how the rates of general inflation of the developed countries were going down, although they have been situated far from the objectives of the central banks. The fall of the price of energy (with the natural gas <30 EUR / MWh and the Brent oil surpassing only 75 $/bbl) and certain statistical effects explain a good part of the slowdown. But, also, a more moderate behavior of certain structural factors: the normalization of the chains of global supply supply, the fall of the prices of industrial goods and the basics, even greater energy, and the lower prices of the lower prices of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price, and lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the price of the price of the price of the lower price of the lower price of the lower price of the price of the lower price of the price of the lower price of the price of the lower price of the price of the lower price of the price of the lower price of the price of the lower price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of the price of, {'error': 'Model Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en is currently loading', 'estimated_time': 20.0}, {'error': 'Model Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en is currently loading', 'estimated_time': 20.0}, {'error': 'Model Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en is currently loading', 'estimated_time': 20.0}, {'error': 'Model Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en is currently loading', 'estimated_time': 20.0}, {'error': 'Model Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en is currently loading', 'estimated_time': 20.0}, {'error': 'Model Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en is currently loading', 'estimated_time': 20.0}, We have gone from value-quality to prefer growth and momentum. 11 The valuations of the equities in this first semester have given way to an increase of the majority of indices. In the case of the US with marked prominence of the expansion of multiples to the heat of the technology. In the case of Europe hand in hand of the business results in its majority. Thus, the indicators of price earnings ratio to twelve months seen are placed in the American case above the 20x, while in Europe they are closer to their historical average of 13-14x. Finally to point out that the crossing EURUSD has remained in the year within a wide range that has gone from 1.05 to 1.11 according to the expectations of interest rates, flows and economic performance of the two areas. b) General decisions of investment adopted Our index has been recorded another 2.5% in this second quarter, closing the first part of the year with a return close to the 2 digits (9.5%). We have been quite active in the management and has produced some rotation of sectors coming out of those more defensives than in the second quarter., On Holding (the brand of sportswear of which Roger Federer is a shareholder) or the chain of organic food stores Spruts Farmers. c) Index of reference. It has no reference index. The accumulated profitability in the semester of the letter of the Treasury to 1 year is -1,11% compared to 9.5% of profitability of the IIC. d) Evolution of the Heritage, participations, profitability and expenses of the Fund. In the semester the patrimony has increased 9.61% and the number of participants has fallen 2,17%. During the semester the IIC has obtained a positive profitability of 9.5% and has borne an expense of 0.97% on the average patrimony, having not borne indirect expenses. e) Performance of the fund compared to the rest of the funds of the manager. During the semester analyzed the average profitability of the funds of the same category managed by the managing entity has been 2.83 %. 2.;. a) Concrete investments made during the period. We have been quite active in the management and there has been rotation of sectors coming out of those more defensive ones as is the case of Coca Cola or with very adjusted valuations (L ́Oreal) and we have entered companies with a somewhat more cyclical profile (Bowlero) or that had suffered from the adjustments of inventories (Garmin). Other entries to be highlighted in this last trimester are those of Brembo (high range brakes for sports vehicles), On Holding (the brand of sportswear of which is shareholder Roger Federer) or the chain of organic food stores Sprouts Farmers. The assets that have behaved best in this last trimester are those of NVIDIA CORP, (2.05%), also MICROSOFT CORP (1.48%), and MONCLER SPA (1.19%). By the negative part we have BOWERO CORP, (-1.11%), to INTL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES (-0.87%), and to DARLING INGREDIENTIENTIGNIGNIOR ITS (-0.66%)., During the six-month reference period, the IIC has operated with derivative instruments, which have been the following: Future Dollar Euro FX CME maturities 03/23, 06/23 and 09/23 and Future s/S&P Emini 500 03/23. The result in derivatives in the six-month period has been -0.61% on average assets. Average leverage during the six-month period has been 3%, generated by investment in derivatives. d) Other investment information. 12 In the end of the six-month investment period, the percentage of assets in IICs is used both quantitative and qualitative selection criteria, focusing on funds with sufficient history to be able to analyse their behaviour in different market situations. The policies for managing funds purchased must be consistent with the strategy of each of the institutions. At the end of the six-month period, the percentage on assets in IIC is 0%. The average return on annualised liquidity over the period has been 1.4%.;Not applicable;. Volatility is a risk measure that measures how the profitability of the fund has been diverted from its historical average. A high deviation means that the profitability of the fund has experienced strong variations in the past, while a low deviation indicates that these returns have been much more stable over time. The IIC has included in its brochure a maximum annualized volatility limit of 25%. The volatility of the fund in the period has been 10.26% (annualized), while that of the Ibex 35 has been 15.61% and that of the Treasury Letter a year has been 1.07%, because it has maintained assets of lower risk than the IBEX. The historical VaR is a measure that assumes that the past will be repeated in the future and indicates the maximum that could be lost, with a confidence level of 99% within a month, taking into account the assets that make up the portfolio at a given time. The historical VaR at the end of the fund period has been 12.57%. 5.;. We will seek to remain quite active in the management and to carry out the rotation of sectors that are giving us such good results, within the special characteristics of this thematic fund. 13
ES0146309002;The manager/company’s view of the market situation Do drums sound like a potential bubble in the technology sector? We can’t assure it with certainty. However, there are reasons for concern in the stock market behavior of some of the most important companies in this industry. The starter gun that has led to the launch of ChatGPT, by the OpenAI company, for the deployment of generational artificial intelligence, has meant a (concerning) stock drive in the sector and, more specifically, in the companies named as magnificent seven. Since Horos, we don’t intend to label this behavior as bubble, nor do we want to dilute whether their valuations are justified or not. It’s not our game. However, we think it’s important to understand the dynamics that can hide behind this evolution, as well as the potential risks that the market seems to ignore at these times. In particular, in this first half of 2023, the NASDAQ-100 index is noted above 40%.the performance of the fixed income does not seem to be as optimistic as that of the variable income and some central bankers continue to send signs of monetary hardness in the coming months. Again, we do not know what will happen. Our focus will continue to be put on analyzing company by company and isolating us from factors that we cannot control, although it does continue with interest for its impact on the behavior of the different markets. 8 General decisions of investment adopted As always, from Horos Asset Management S.G.I.I.C., SA (Horos), we try to adapt and take advantage of the situation, rebalancing the portfolio towards those investments with greater potential, to the detriment of those companies that have presented a good stock evolution in the last months and, therefore, to throw a lower potential of revaluation. These operations, in case of having produced one in the period of 2023 each of this index has been broken down by reference The reference index used for the international strategy is the MSCI ACWI net TR EUR, more representative index of the exchanges worldwide. This index takes into account the net dividendss. The profitability in the first half of the period of 2023 each period of this index has been 11.5%.The maximum daily profitability reached in the semester was 2.1%, while the minimum daily profitability was - 2.3%. The total expenses incurred by the fund in the first semester have been 0.93%, being the management commission 1.8% per year. The liquidative value reached its quarterly minimum on January 1, 2023, being 126.50 euros, while its maximum liquidative value was reached on March 3, 2023, at 139.10 euros. Performance of the fund compared to the rest of the funds of the manager The managing company manages another strategy of Iberian variable income: Horos Value Iberia. This fund obtained in the semester a profitability of 8.9%.;Concrete investments carried out during the period The most significant movements that have occurred in the portfolio of Horos Value International are the sale of our position in the company tests, inspection and certification Applus Services, after the OPA received by the Apollo group, and in the company of car dealers Vertu Motors. In turn, we have invested in the Italian financial company Azimut Holding and reinvested, only one quarter after our departure, in the company of data services for the oil and gas industry TGS. In this period, the values that have contributed most to the portfolio of the fund are Mistras Group (1.9%), Bayerische Motoren Werke (0.9%) and Alphabet INC (0.9%). The values that have contributed less to the fund are Nagacorp (-1.0%), Kaisa Prosperity Holdings (-1.5%) and CIR (-0.37%). The weight at the end of the main sectors is 22.7% in Financial, 14.5% in Holding, 10% in Industrial, 8.5% in Consumings, 8.9% in Commercial, 8.7% in Sectors, 3.3% in SectorsThe fund does not make use of derivative instruments. Other investment information In Horos we know the long-term benefits of value investment, so we follow this investment philosophy in a disciplined way. The value investment consists in investing in companies whose shares are listed with a high margin of security over their value. That is, we invest in companies that, after analyzing them, consider that they have a value higher than the price they ask us for on the stock market. This reasonable investment philosophy has proved to be very successful throughout the stock market history. We dedicate most of our time to the study of companies, to the understanding of their business models and to the calculation of their fundamental value.;Not applicable;Apart from the particular risks of each of the companies in which we invest, we can say that, in general terms, the greatest risks facing our portfolio are of financial and operational type. In this sense, we face with some quietness these potential financial risks, by presenting the bulk of our portfolio a net cash position or of low indebtedness. In addition, the rest of the companies meet, at least, one of the following requirements: strong capacity to generate cash, defensive businesses, predictable cash flows or assets in property that allow to cover the debt and/or liquidity needs. As for the operational risk, we try to invest in businesses that have some kind of competitive advantage and with a management team aligned with their shareholders (many times family companies) and that carry out a capital management that contributes value to them over time. We are convinced that this is the best way to minimize these potential risks of business. Finally, we would have to add as risks the potential errors that the management team of Horos can make in its analyses of investments.To try to minimize them, we will always invest in those companies that risk they have a high margin of security and additional risk.;By our investment philosophy, we do not try to predict the evolution of the markets and their evolution does not influence how we manage our portfolios. The formation of these is based on a philosophy of value investing. In this sense, we carry out an exhaustive analysis of the companies and select those that we can understand and visualize in the long term, that do not have a high debt and that present barriers of entry to their competitors. In addition, we value that they are well managed companies by their managers and, of course, that they are at an attractive price to invest. We think that this way of investing is still the most suitable in the moment of uncertainty due to the global pandemic of Covid-19, of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, of the high inflation and of the fears to a recession. Especially important is to analyze carefully the situation of liquidity of the companies that we have in portfolio, in order to discard or reduce exposure in those that they can suffer the most from partial or full paralysis of their activity (returned to the confinements, drop of demand or the energy costs insurmountable).But they do give an idea of how attractive the current moment is to invest in Horos Value International. For the calculation of this potential, we carry out an individual study of each investment that composes the portfolio. Specifically, we make a three-year estimate of the value of each company in which we invest. To do this, we conservatively calculate the future cash flows that we think will generate over the next three years the business, in order to be able to calculate the future value of the company (understood this as stock capitalization adjusted by the net financial position). Subsequently, with these data, we estimate the multiple EV/FCF (the future value of the company divided by its normalized free cash flow, that is to say, adjusted the latter by extraordinary items) to which each company would quote. Finally, the result of the qualitative analysis that we carry out of each company, we assign a multiple of exit to each investment (to how much we think that each business deserves to quote) and compare it with the previous data, to estimate the potential or attractiveness of the investment.
ES0182527038;a) The manager/society’s view of the market situation. The first half of 2023 closes with significant increases (+11% with dividends) in the European variable income and a monetary environment radically different from what has been experienced since the financial crisis.Inflation remains well above 2%, the official objective of the ECB, closing the semester the general index of the eurozone above 6% and the underlying one at 5.4%.The ECB has continued to increase its rate of intervention and the Euribor to twelve months, which was in negative less than two years ago, reaches 4.2% at the end of the semester from 3.2% at the end of the 2022.The long-term interest rates fall slightly, so that the curve of interest rates is narrowed clearly (long rates of credit or raw materials seem to announce a particularly intense or lasting recession. Perhaps the consensus or fear of more louder than the central recession is today, and the credit differentials have risen somewhat.Net has produced a new bifurcation in valuation and performance of certain sectors (in general the cheapest and cyclical vs. technology and growth) similar to that that existed at the end of 2021 and that played in favor of the fund during 2022. In fixed income we have passed from TINA (There Is No Alternative), which pushed the managers to take more and more risks to achieve a certain profitability, to TARA (There is A Reasonable Alternative). The increase of interest rates has not only allowed to build portfolios with reasonable yields to maturity in nominal terms but also higher than expected inflation, all with better quality of risk and less duration than has been possible for many years. 10 b) General investment decisions adopted. The level of investment in variable income has been stable in the semester somewhat below 80%. During the semester it has left the portfolio Novartis and have started positions in Michelin and Brentag. The portfolio of variable income has increased 8% in the semester while the last reference index (MSCI Europe Total Return Index) has been increased by 11%. It is important to note that the 5th year of the fund has been made up.the fund does not aim to beat the profitability of the index in absolute terms but in terms of return adjusted by risk, being its objective to obtain a return-risk (measured by the ratio of Sharpe) in the long term in excess of its benchmark. Therefore, it is very likely that the fund has a behavior different from that of the benchmark index to the extent that the fund has more or less liquidity or the performance of the stock exchange portfolio (usually around thirty-five securities) deviates from the performance of the values of the benchmark, composed by more than four hundred companies. The fund, from the beginning, has obtained a return-risk higher than its benchmark. d) Evolution of the assets, shares, profitability and expenses of the IIC. The assets of the fund rise by 7% in the first half and the number of members remains stable. The fund rises by 5.8% in the first half with a level of average investment in variable income of 79%.4%. The lower profitability of Cartesio X is explained by an average weight of 23 per cent in equities in the semester (vs. 79 per cent for Cartesio Y) that has not been fully compensated by the positive profitability of the fixed income (average weight of 57 per cent) that has risen by 3.5 per cent.;(a) Concrete investments made during the period. During the six-month period, Novartis has left the portfolio and positions have been started in Michelin and Brenntag. (b) Securities lending operation. N/A. The fund does not carry out operational securities lending. (c) Derivatives operation and temporary asset acquisition. The operation of derivatives from the fund (Annex 3.3) reflects the coverage, which may be partial or total, of investments denominated in currency and variable income investment through options and futures of the Eurostoxx 50. At the end of the six-month period, the fund maintained partial foreign exchange risk coverage. (d) Other investment information. N/A;N/A. The fund does not have a specific objective of profitability.;The volatility of the fund in the first semester (9.9%) has been below its historical average (10.9%). The relative volatility of the fund with respect to its reference index (MSCI Europe Net Total Return Index ) has been (84%) above its historical average (59%), rising in the second quarter with respect to the first.;We think that the European equity market is in no one’s land in terms of valuation, i.e. online valuations with historical averages in general. However, we see a very attractive valuation in our portfolio as a whole, due to its exposure to some cyclical, oil and integrated energy sectors, banks and real estate. In all these companies the market accounts for already very adverse scenarios that we believe give us a considerable margin of protection to current valuations. At current prices, we see no substantial changes in the background in the coming months. The great positive surprise, for which the markets are not prepared, would be a strong slowdown in inflation along with acceptable economic growth.
V66236498;a) The manager/society’s vision of the market situation. January started with a lot of force in variable income due to expectations of containment of inflation greater than those of the previous months, however, the following months we saw the most stable environment, except for March. March was a volatile month and strong declines in the companies of the financial sector due to the collapse of the SVB, and the purchase of Credit Suisse by UBS. Our exposure to this sector is limited to a Spanish bank and a Dutch insurer. We do not have any direct or indirect exposure to the SVB or Credit Suisse. Moreover, we consider both cases to be very specific (SVB was an entity in charge of lending to small technology companies, and Credit Suisse was dragging structural problems for years), and we should not extrapolate to the whole financial sector. On the other hand, the latest data of inflation are being very good both in Europe and the United States. And this makes us think that we are close to the end of the increases of rates. Central banks, however, we still see their consumption, based on the underlying inflation, we more than in the companies’s.The market is following this year with the trend that we have already seen in 2022 of penalizing the companies of small and medium capitalization versus the big ones. The liquidity risk continues to prevail in an uncertain economic scenario. However, we think that this is generating a very good opportunity to invest in good companies to multiples very attractive. As we always indicate, we have a diversified portfolio and we do not have a concrete macro strategic positioning. We analyze company to company and its management team, and we choose those ideas that we think have the tools to navigate in any economic environment. b) General decisions of investment adopted. In Valentum we understand that we can generate value by means of stock picking¿, that is, the choice of investments, company per company. We do not actively position ourselves in certain sectors by expectations. This does not imply that we do not follow what happens in the different sectors, being a relevant criterion every time we make a decision about an individual title. What we do is take advantage of strong decreases to buy companies that we like but that we usually quoted something expensive.64% with 118.96M? of assets and 2373 participants. The comparison with the main indices places us below in terms of profitability. Since the beginning of the year the Eurostoxx 50 has increased by +18.39%, the Ibex35 has increased by +18.78% and the S&P 500 in EUR has increased by +14.06%. The TER of the fund of the last semester was 0.72%. The cumulative of the year is 0.72%. e) Performance of the fund compared to the rest of the funds of the manager. The evolution of the liquidative value during the first semester of Valentum FI has been +5.64% compared to the profitability of the rest of managed IICs, which is detailed below: Valentum Magno FI (ES0182719007) +14.72%;(a) Concrete investments made during the period. In Valentum FI, during the first half of the year, we have left completely from Qbeyond, RHI Magnesita, Alphabet, Nagarro, Quipt, Thor, GK Software, Parlem and BTS. We have continued to increase exposure to the ideas of greater conviction such as Rovi, CIE and Bekaert, and we have entered into three new names. (b) Securities lending operation. Not applicable c) Derivatives operation and temporary asset acquisition. During the period, the average exposure in derivatives has been 1.61%. And the total exposure in quarterly derivatives has been 0.52%. (d) Other investment information. Investment policy remains unchanged, looking for securities where we rely on management teams with little debt and large cash generation. It is noteworthy that, as a result of our traditional large approach to company balance sheets, the portfolio has a weighted net-cash average.;Not applicable;The average exposure during the period was 85.80%. The volatility of the fund during the semester was 13.87%, lower than that of the reference index that has been placed at 15%.;We keep a portfolio where we see potential in all securities. Risks, as we mentioned earlier, have risen, although we think that most are transitory and will depend to a large extent on the magnitude and timing of central bank decisions. Market declines make us think that the opportunity for long-term investors can be very good. However, we do not know and cannot predict the impacts of macroeconomic factors on equity markets, nor what the stock markets will do.
V87171005;a) Manager/society’s view of the market situation respectively The prospects for global growth remain modest. According to the latest OECD report of June 2023, world GDP growth in 2023 is expected to be 2.7%, the lowest annual rate since the global financial crisis, with the exception of the period of the 2020 pandemic. By 2024, a slight improvement is estimated to be 2.9%. Apart from the slower economic recovery than expected from post-Covid China and the stagnation of economic growth in the euro area, the debate continues to revolve around the US of whether it eventually enters recession or not. For the time being, the major international agencies such as the IMF or the OECD foresee positive growth for the US economy both by 2023 and by 2024. Different to the forecasts for Germany that point to a slight decrease by 2023 within a euro area which as a whole should show a modest economic growth for both years. The high rates of inflation, although falling back from its last year’s peaks, along with strong increases of the reference rates for the main central banks are cooling the overall economic rate of activity.4%, respectively, have caused a moderation in inflation rates. In this sense, euro area inflation has relaxed to levels of 5.5% in June after having reached maximums above 10% in October 2022. Inflation has even moderated to 4% after having reached levels of 9% last year. However, the strength of the labour market and consequently the continuous pressures on the rise of labor costs have a negative impact on the underlying inflation and high levels are still observed above 5% which makes the main central banks remain in surveillance and for the time being are more by the work to increase their reference rates as mentioned above. In this environment, the volatility in the markets has been the general tonic, although the exchanges managed to close the semester in positive territory, namely the +8.7% for the case of European shares, measured by the index STOXX Europe 600, and the +13.4% for the US S&P 500 measured in euro. b) Reference index The benchmark used for the European strategy is the reference period of the MSCI Europe TR Net, whose profitability in the period* has been used by the STOX Europe index.It increased by +32.1% to 253,6 million euros in class M, and increased by +22.2% to 541,0 million euros in class P. The number of shareholdings increased in the period* by 5, representing 372 shareholdings in class E. The number of shareholdings increased in the period* by 1,048, representing 6,833 shareholdings in class M and increased in the period* by 259, representing 3,173 shareholdings in class P. The return of the fund during the semester was +14,91% and the increase in the year was +14,91% for class E. The return of the fund during the semester was +14,20% and the accumulated in the past year was +14,20% for class M. The return of the fund during the semester was +14,48% for class P. The return rate in the year was +14,48% for class P. The total expenditure supported by the fund was 0,27% during the semester for class E, 0.89% for class M and 0,04% for class P.;a) Concrete investments made during the period During the first semester the Fund has carried out certain adjustments as a result of the normal activity of the portfolio. Cocnrementamente, we have replenished positions in the Swiss tourist operator Dufry AG, in the Irish company of drinks C&C Group Plc, owner of the brands of cider Bulmers and Magners and of the beer Tennent?s. We have also added some weight in the French supermarket chain Carrefour and in the chemical company and fertilizers OCI NV. On the side of the sales, we have sold totally our position in the Greek company Mytilineos. Among the companies best positioned in terms of contribution to the profitability in the period, it is important to highlight UniCredit (+2.7%), Real Heidelberg Materials (+1.80%), Forvia (+1.79%), easyJet (+1.67%) and Wizz Air (+1.34%). On the other hand, among the companies that have contributed negatively over the period are Aker period BP (-0.82%), OCI & NV (0.5%), and CIT).the understanding of their business models and the calculation of their fundamental value. The investment strategy of the period has fulfilled the binding elements for the selection and maintenance of the companies present in Magallanes European Equity, FI. 100% of the companies present in Magallanes European Equity, FI, have a score (or scoring) ESG obtained with the internal methodology specified in the IF brochure, less than 7 out of 10.;Not applicable;Taking into account all those factors of macroeconomic uncertainty and especially those related to the impact of Covid-19, there could be a scenario of further economic slowdown at a global level that would negatively affect those sectors most exposed to the economy, such as the cyclical sectors. For example, the result could be lower car sales and a fall in prices of the main raw materials, among others.;Given our strong exposure to the industrial sectors and cyclical consumption, represented mainly by the automotive, oil, fertilizer and distribution sectors, any normalization in the perception of these sectors could lead to an appreciation of the value of the assets of the Fund due to its potential attractiveness. Such estimated potential is composed of the weighted average of the valuations of each company forming the portfolio in a standardised market scenario. In turn, the individual valuations of each company are based on internal valuation models, such as flow discounts, sum of parts and multiples, among others. Such models are duly documented and updated, within the normal management and financial analysis activity of the investment management department of Magallanes. The previous potential would be reduced by a negative overall growth scenario of the main economies where our companies operate, or by a distraught situation for one of our companies in particular within the fund (fraud, default or similar) or by any other of the risks to which the fund is subject. On the other hand, any positive surprises in the macroeconomic environment, whether for greater growth of global GDP, reduction of inflation or a benign environment for international trade (OPA or similar) or for each other of a similar enterprise.
V88585815;a. Vision of the manager on the situation of the markets. TEXT OF THE GESTORA VISION ABSTRACT 1S23 The first semester of 2023 has been settled with generalized increases in the variable income: with double digit revaluations for the Eurostoxx 50, S&P 500 in the Nasdaq and +29% for the Nikkei. The worst relative behavior has been seen in the FTSE 100 British, the Dow Jones and the Shanghai Index. The increases are explained by a somewhat better economic situation than expected, a positioning in variable income very weak at the beginning of the period, the agreement of the US debt ceiling, and the impulse of artificial intelligence and the technological megacaps. All this in spite of having drawn several levels of employment minicrisis, without great corrections, like the tension in regional banks of the United States, the caída of Credit Suisse, increases of types above the expected, tension in the US commercial sector, the greater cost of capital, the gas sector and the quality of the German economy or the lower income.With regard to inflation, while we are seeing a rapid general disinflation, underlying inflation remains above central bank targets. In Europe, inflation in the euro area has fallen in June to 5.5%, the best figure since January 2022. With regard to fixed income, the first half of the year has been characterized by the changing outlook for central banks’ monetary policy. While we closed last year with initial indications that inflation was beginning to moderate, the figures for inflation and job creation left us in the semester a panorama of greater economic resilience that pointed to more persistent inflation and higher interest rate increases on the part of central banks. All of this has resulted in an increasing investment of the rates curves of the public debt, which rise in the shorter sections, until the two years, while the rest of the curve remains more anchored.the first half of 2023 has continued to have a volatile behavior in the markets due to a more persistent inflation than expected and the possibility of an economic recession.The determining factor has been the expectations of growth and the increases of interest rates that have continued to happen these months.We estimate a low impact 15 in the long term on our investments due to Covid-19, the solvency of our investments is very high and there has not been any company of the fund that has had financial problems that could threaten its continuity.For this reason, we have maintained a high exposure to variable income.The valuations that are observed in the markets and especially in the companies where it invests True Value Small Caps fund are attractive for the long term. c. Index of reference period. N/A d. Evolution of the patrimony, sharers, profitability and expenses of the IIC. - Class A The asset of the fund is situated 10,823 million euros at the end of the period against 11,327 million euros at the end of the previous period. The number of participants has been diminished during the period, from the period from 1160 to 1098 to 1098.59% compared to 6.32% at the end of the previous period.

During the period, the volatility of the fund is 10.08% compared to 15.01% of the previous period.puts it below the average profitability obtained by the funds of the same investment vocation ( INTERNATIONAL VARIABLE RENTA ) belonging to the manager, which is 4.5%;"a. Concrete investments made during the period. True Value Small Caps FI closes the first half of 2023 with liquidity of 9%. The level of liquidity has decreased due to the opportunities we have found in the market. The level of liquidity will evolve in the coming months according to the intrinsic valuations of the companies of the fund. The portfolio of variable income represents 91% of the patrimony with a global exposure, composed mainly by companies such as Nagarro, Goeasy, GDI, SII, API, S&U, Somec, Newlat and SDI. As for diversification by sectors, the ones that have the greatest weight are: Technology with SII and Nagarro; Construction and Engineering with API and Somec; and Finance with Goeasy, Línea Directa and S&U. The fund has bought more shares in securities such as Nagarro, Goeasy and GDI; and has incorporated Newlat, Onex and Auto Nation. The values that have had the best relative behavior have been Goeasy, SII, API and Newlat. b. Other loan operation in derivatives and temporary operations.";Class A The profitability of -0.54% puts the bottom below the average profitability obtained by its Benchmark Index, which is 2.79% Class B The profitability of -0.59% puts the bottom below the average profitability obtained by its Benchmark Index, which is 2.79% Class C The profitability of -0.69% puts the bottom below the average profitability obtained by its Benchmark Index, which is 2.79%;During the first semester the volatility of the society has been 12.74, compared to the volatility of the indices in the same period that is 15.08 for the Ibex 35, 15.71 for the Eurostoxx, and 18.03 for the S&P. The Sharpe Ratio at the end of the period is 12.74. The Sortino ratio is -0.29 while the Downside Risk is -0.26.;True Value Small Caps has the long-term investment philosophy, so for the new semester the management team will continue to use liquidity to increase the equity weight if the markets offer good opportunities. If the market continues to decline, we will reduce the weight in those investments with the best performance to invest in the opportunities that the market presents. In parallel, the fund will evaluate investing in new shares if they present a better risk-reward ratio than any of the ideas already present in the fund.The market will remain very volatile in the short term due to uncertainty in Ukraine, rate increases and high levels of inflation until the economy returns to normal. PERSPECTIVES 2023 OF THE GESTORA In variable income, a combination of weak positioning, negative feeling at the beginning of the year, along with macro and business data better than expected, in a scenario without many marginal sellers and with some beta persecutions explain the revaluation of double digits in the main indices. Thus, a second semester begins with somewhat stronger positioning/feeling in variable income on the market, somewhat lower than expected, and with somewhat more significant valuations. The nominal types and persecutions have increased in the most difficult market rates in the most difficult.With a post-Covid boost below what was expected a few months ago. In Europe, the PMI indices point to a clear slowdown of the manufacturing sector, with profit warnings in several sectors. The market realizes that inflation has reached ceiling, already there have been cuts in business profits, and that the rates will normalize in levels below the current ones. Our base scenario is that we will continue to live together with real low rates, an inflation above the targets of central banks, and a weak economic growth, below the potential growth. At the micro/business level, facing 2023, the consensus points to stagnated profits with a year from less to more, to later grow in 2024. From a point of view of valuation, after a strong de-rating situation in 2021-22, there has been an expansion in multiples in October 2022. The US S&P is quoted 19x, compared to the 15x in Oct-22 and average 2000-today of 17x. Europe deserves to the 10x of oct-22 and the corporate average level of 13.5x.With regard to fixed income, after the intense tightening of monetary policy by central banks and the consequent increase in the profitability of public debt, we believe that this market presents investment opportunities at attractive returns, despite the uncertainty about the interest rate scenario. We believe that when employment data begins to show a deterioration we will be able to begin to visualize stabilization at interest rates and will be the time to increase its duration. We also consider the levels of corporate debt to be attractive. We believe that current levels are an opportunity to improve the credit quality of the portfolio and reduce subordination. In terms of deadlines, we continue to see the shortest deadlines more attractive. On the high yield side, we are very cautious about the macro uncertainty scenario we face.
